Office of Engineering and Technology, Wireless Telecommunications Bureau, and Office of 
Strategic Planning Announce Workshop on “Spectrum Efficiency and Receiver Performance” 
As part of the Commission’s efforts to enhance the use of spectrum for mobile broadband, the 
FCC Office of Engineering and Technology, in conjunction with the Wireless Telecommunications 
Bureau and the Office of Strategic Planning will host a workshop on spectrum efficiency and receivers.  
The workshop will be held on Monday, March 12, 2012 and Tuesday, March 13, 2012, in the 
Commission Meeting Room at FCC Headquarters in Washington, DC. 
The role of receivers in enabling access to spectrum for new services implicates federal 
stakeholders, as well as the private sector.  Receiver performance issues have often arisen as a conflict 
between legacy stakeholders and new entrants where deployment of new technologies and services 
threatens to adversely impact an incumbent or place restrictions on the new entrant.  Past examples 
include interference issues between new cellular radio systems and public safety radio systems,1 satellite 
digital radio systems and proposed terrestrial data services,2 unlicensed WiFi systems and FAA weather 
radar systems,3 and ancillary terrestrial service on mobile satellite spectrum and GPS4.  The resolution of 
such matters has historically required a public process involving regulators, stakeholders and other 
parties. Because such discussions sometime begin upon the introduction of a new service or technology, 
full deployment of such new services could be hindered. New approaches to spectrum management 
focusing on spectrum efficiency and receiver performance may enable more assured deployment of new 
services and reduce the necessity for the involvement of regulators.
This two-day workshop will discuss the characteristics of receivers and how their performance 
can affect the efficient use of spectrum and opportunities for the creation of new services.  Key topics will 
include current practices for receiver design, case studies involving interference due to receiver 
characteristics, and approaches for promoting interference avoidance and efficient use of spectrum, given 
the current receiver base and potential future deployments.  The workshop will include perspectives from 
licensees, equipment manufacturers, component providers, and other interested parties.

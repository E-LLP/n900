REPORT AND ORDER 
Adopted:  March 22, 2012 Released:  March 23, 2012
By the Commission:
I. INTRODUCTION
1. By this action, we modify Part 15 of the rules governing the operation of Unlicensed 
Personal Communications Service (UPCS) devices in the 1920-1930 MHz frequency band (UPCS band) 
to promote more efficient use of the UPCS band and to facilitate the introduction of a new generation of 
unlicensed devices capable of supporting broadband connectivity using Digital Enhanced Cordless 
Telecommunications (DECT) technology.1 Specifically, we eliminate the least-interfered channel 
monitoring threshold for UPCS devices and reduce the number of duplex system access channels that a 
UPCS device must define and monitor from 40 to 20 channels in order to use the least-interfered channel 
access method.  These changes will provide UPCS devices, particularly those designed to transmit with 
wider bandwidths, access to more usable channels (i.e., combined time and spectrum windows) than are 
permitted under the existing rules and unleash innovative cordless broadband technologies in the UPCS 
band, while limiting the potential for causing interference to other devices.  We also modify the rules to 
remove outdated provisions and to make other minor updates.  
II. BACKGROUND
2. The 1920-1930 MHz band is allocated to Fixed and Mobile services on a primary basis 
and is designated for use by UPCS devices on an unlicensed basis.2 Currently, the major use of the 
1920-1930 MHz band is for unlicensed cordless telephones that operate under Part 15 of the 
Commission’s rules.3 The Part 15 rules provide that the 1920-1930 MHz band may be used for both 
asynchronous (generally data) and isochronous (generally voice) UPCS devices, with maximum and 
minimum emission bandwidths of 2.5 megahertz and 50 kilohertz, respectively.4 UPCS devices operating 
  
1 DECT-based radio technology facilitates voice, data, and networking applications with range requirements up to a 
few hundred meters.
2 See 47 C.F.R. §§ 2.106, 15.301.
3 See DECT Solutions at http://www.dect.org.  See also Plantronics, Inc. (Plantronics) Comments at 1.
4 See 47 C.F.R. §§ 15.303(a) and (d), 15.323(a).  UPCS systems may sub-divide the 2.5 megahertz emission 
bandwidth as long as the sub-divided emission bandwidth is greater than or equal to 50 kilohertz.  Under the Part 15 
rules, a UPCS channel is defined as the combined time and spectrum windows that a transmission is intended to 
occupy.  47 C.F.R. § 15.323(c).  Spectrum window is defined as the amount of spectrum equal to the intended 
emission bandwidth in which operation is desired.  47 C.F.R. § 15.303(h).

in the 1920-1930 MHz band are subject to the general conditions of operation for Part 15 devices in that 
they may not cause harmful interference to authorized radio services and must accept any interference 
received.5
3. To facilitate the sharing of spectrum in the UPCS band, the current rules require use of a 
“spectrum etiquette” that specifies a process for monitoring the time and spectrum windows that a 
transmission is intended to occupy for signals above a defined threshold (a “listen-before-transmit” 
protocol).  To protect UPCS devices already using particular time and spectrum windows from 
transmissions from another device, each UPCS device must monitor the combined time and spectrum 
windows that it intends to use before beginning transmissions and defer use or find other spectrum 
windows if the monitored signal level is above the threshold.6 Transmissions may commence with the 
same emission bandwidth in a monitored time and spectrum window without further monitoring if no 
signal greater than 30 decibels (dB) above thermal noise is detected in the chosen window.7  
Alternatively, if the UPCS system defines and the UPCS device can monitor at least 40 duplex system 
access channels, the UPCS device may access the time and spectrum windows with the lowest signal 
level below a threshold of 50 dB above thermal noise (henceforth referred to as the “least-interfered 
channel access method”).8 If the initially selected combined time and spectrum windows are unavailable, 
the UPCS device may either monitor and select different windows or seek to use the same windows after 
waiting a randomly chosen amount of time between 10 and 150 milliseconds.9  
4. On May 6, 2010, the Commission adopted a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (UPCS 
Band NPRM) in this proceeding that proposed changes designed to allow UPCS devices to access 
additional usable channels.10 The Commission took this action in response to a petition for rulemaking 
filed by the DECT Forum, an industry association that promotes digital cordless radio technology for 
short-distance voice and data applications.11 In the UPCS Band NPRM, the Commission proposed to 
increase the least-interfered channel monitoring threshold from 50 to 65 dB above thermal noise and
sought comment on whether some alternative value or elimination of the threshold would be more 
  
5 See 47 C.F.R. § 15.5(b).  
6 See 47 C.F.R. § 15.323(c)(1)-(12).  See also n.4, supra.  To prevent the monopolization of UPCS-band channels by 
one or more devices, the Commission’s rules also include UPCS transmission time limits.  See 47 C.F.R. 
§ 15.323(c)(3).  The access threshold, transmitter power limits, and transmission time limits are designed such that 
frequency and time reuse both within a system and between systems are possible for indoor operations.
7 See 47 C.F.R. § 15.323(c)(1)-(3).  UPCS devices that have a power output lower than the permitted maximum may 
increase their monitoring threshold by 1 dB for each 1 dB that the transmitter power is below the permitted 
maximum.  See 47 C.F.R. § 15.323(c)(9).  Thermal noise power, typically referred to as thermal noise, is produced 
by the random thermal agitation of electrons in an electronic circuit.  The thermal noise power (in dBm) for a given 
emission (i.e., channel) bandwidth is defined by the formula 10 log (1000 x kTB), where k is Boltzmann’s Constant 
(1.38 x 10-23 W/Hz/K); T is the ambient temperature in degrees Kelvin (e.g., 298º K at room temperature (77º F)); 
and B is the emission bandwidth of the device in Hertz.  See 47 C.F.R. § 15.303(j).  The thermal noise in a 
50 kilohertz channel at room temperature is -127 dBm.
8 See 47 C.F.R. § 15.323(c)(5).  
9 See 47 C.F.R. § 15.323(c)(6).

appropriate.12 The Commission also proposed to reduce the number of channels that must be defined and 
monitored under the least-interfered channel access method from 40 to 20 channels.13 It additionally 
sought comment on removing Sections 15.303(b) and (e), 15.307, and 15.311 regarding coordination with 
UTAM, Inc., since the relocation of incumbent fixed services from the band is now complete.14 The 
Commission further sought comment on a number of proposed updates to the Part 15 UPCS rules 
regarding measurement procedures and definitions.15 Eight parties filed comments in response to the 
UPCS Band NPRM; these parties all strongly support the Commission’s proposals.16 No parties filed 
reply comments.    
III. DISCUSSION 
5. Based on our analysis of the record, we decide to eliminate the 50 dB above thermal 
noise monitoring threshold for UPCS devices.  Without this threshold, after monitoring the required 
minimum number of channels, UPCS devices may use the combined time and spectrum windows with the 
lowest signal level, rather than using only those windows with the lowest signal level below 50 dB above 
thermal noise.  Coupled with a reduction in the number of channels that must be monitored, elimination 
of this threshold will permit greater utilization of the UPCS band.17 For example, manufacturers could 
optimize cordless telephones for higher-density applications, such as office environments.  These changes 
are also expected to encourage manufacturers to introduce innovative products and services using Internet 
  
12 See UPCS Band NPRM, 25 FCC Rcd at 5124 ¶ 14.  The UPCS Band NPRM acknowledged that the DECT Forum 
and others asserted that an increase in the least-interfered channel monitoring threshold is needed so the out-of-band 
emissions from future devices transmitting in the 1915-1920 MHz Advanced Wireless Service (AWS) band –
commonly known as the “H Block” – will not restrict UPCS devices’ access to a major part of the 1920-1930 MHz 
band.  The UPCS Band NPRM noted that the issue of out-of-band emissions for the “H Block” was being addressed 
in a separate proceeding and thus did not solicit comments on nor make any decision with respect to this issue.  See 
UPCS Band NPRM, 25 FCC Rcd at 5122 ¶ 9, 5125-26 ¶ 17.  Nonetheless, several commenters on the UPCS Band 
NPRM express support for increasing the monitoring threshold for this reason.  See DECT Forum Comments at 1, 4;

UPCS use, is a non-profit corporation composed of representatives from a broad range of UPCS equipment 
manufacturers that the Unlicensed PCS Ad Hoc Committee for 2 GHz Microwave Transition and Management

protocol connectivity to combine access to broadband and telephony applications in a new generation of 
cordless devices.18
6. First, we conclude that the 50 dB above thermal noise least-interfered channel monitoring 
threshold for UPCS devices operating in the 1920-1930 MHz band should be eliminated.  Eliminating the 
least-interfered channel monitoring threshold will allow UPCS devices to use additional time and 
spectrum windows with higher signal levels and will allow access to more usable time and spectrum 
windows than under the current rule, thereby increasing the flexibility for innovation, utilization, and 
efficiency of the UPCS band.19 Further, this change will not inhibit the ability of UPCS devices to access 
available time and spectrum windows.  Moreover, eliminating, instead of just increasing, the monitoring 
threshold, will provide manufacturers with the flexibility to produce UPCS systems that can operate with 
the maximum possible traffic capacity and thereby maximize the utilization of the UPCS band.  We agree 
with commenters that a higher monitoring threshold would not result in an increase in interference due to 
the path-loss and propagation characteristics of existing UPCS deployments and because UPCS devices 
are designed to use minimal power at all times.20 Finally, we note that although the DECT standard, 
which is used in over 100 countries, including all European countries, defines an upper signal limit at 
which a channel is considered busy and should not be used, it has no upper power threshold on 
least-interfered channels, and it appears that devices are operating under rules similar to those that we are 
adopting here without experiencing interference problems.21
7. Without a predetermined maximum threshold, manufacturers will also have the flexibility 
to select an appropriate threshold to prevent harmful interference to other UPCS devices.  We expect that 
UPCS devices will continue to operate using the DECT standard, which includes a listen-before-transmit 
protocol, and that UPCS devices will continue to monitor the desired channels to avoid causing harmful 
interference to other UPCS devices.  Thus, they will not interfere with each other once a device is 
transmitting on a channel.  Because UPCS devices operate at relatively low power levels, two devices 
would need to be within less than 1 foot of each other to impact one another.22 Thus, the probability of 
interference occurring among UPCS devices operating with a higher monitoring threshold or between 
such devices and those operating under the existing monitoring threshold will remain low.  Although 
eliminating the maximum monitoring threshold could, in some cases, result in an increased number of 
UPCS devices operating simultaneously in a given location, they would be operating with relatively low 
peak transmitter power and out-of-band emissions limits.  Thus, relatively higher-power Advanced 
Wireless Service (AWS) and Personal Communications Service (PCS) devices (either fixed or mobile) 
  
18 See, e.g., Panasonic Comments at 4.  The UPCS band is used primarily by cordless phones that employ DECT 
technology – a flexible digital radio access standard for cordless communications in residential, corporate, and 
public environments.  In addition to providing for voice and multimedia traffic, the DECT standard includes many 
forward-looking technical features that can allow DECT-based cordless systems to be used to offer new 
communications services such as Internet access and interworking with other fixed and wireless services such as 
Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) and Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM).  See DECT

receiving in the adjacent 1915-1920 MHz and 1930-1990 MHz bands, respectively, will not experience 
harmful interference in such cases.        
8. Second, we conclude that the minimum number of channels that must be defined and 
monitored under the least-interfered channel access method can be reduced from 40 to 20 channels 
without posing an additional risk of interference to adjacent band or in-band operations, nor inhibiting the 
ability of UPCS devices to access available channels.23 Reducing the required number of channels that 
must be defined and monitored to 20 channels will enable UPCS devices that define fewer than 
40 channels (i.e., use wider emission bandwidths) to use the least-interfered channel access method and 
access additional usable channels, and thereby encourage manufacturers to produce cordless products that 
can provide access to broadband technologies.24 This action will serve the public interest by promoting 
increased use of the UPCS band for advanced services and allowing state-of-the-art UPCS devices that 
can provide higher throughputs (i.e., data rates) to operate under the least-interfered channel access 
method, thereby further improving the efficiency of the UPCS band, while maintaining equal access to 
the available spectrum on a shared basis for all users.
9. We find that modifying these rules will provide significant benefits to manufacturers and 
consumers.  Because the new rules will include no maximum monitoring threshold and fewer channels to 
define and monitor, UPCS-band products that have already been authorized will continue to be in 
compliance with our technical rules, and UPCS device manufacturers will have the option to introduce 
new technologies and services that will increase the utilization and efficiency of the UPCS band and 
benefit consumers.  Manufacturers may choose to produce UPCS devices that provide higher data rates 
and enable access to broadband technologies, which will increase the efficiency of the UPCS band, 
enhance user experience, and facilitate users’ cordless access to broadband applications.  Manufacturers 
would only incur costs if they choose to take advantage of the flexibility afforded by the new rules, and 
even then we expect such costs would be negligible and consistent with routine design modifications that 
often occur over the life of a product.    
10. In addition, we are taking several actions to update the rules in other ways.  We are 
modifying the Part 15 UPCS rules to reflect that UPCS devices no longer need to protect fixed microwave
incumbents in the 1920-1930 MHz band and are no longer coordinated by UTAM, Inc.  Because the rules 
to transition the 1920-1930 MHz band from incumbent fixed microwave operations to UPCS use sunset 
  
23 See generally DECT Forum Comments; DSPG Comments; Gigaset Comments; Panasonic Comments; Plantronics 
Comments; TIA Comments; Uniden Comments; and VTech Comments.  DSPG, TIA, and VTech further argue that 
reducing the required number of monitored channels from 40 to 20 channels is justified by the Commission’s prior 
decision to increase the maximum UPCS emission bandwidth from 1.25 to 2.5 megahertz.  See DSPG Comments at 
2-3; TIA Comments at 5; and VTech Comments at 3. See Amendment of Part 2 of the Commission’s Rules to

time/frequency windows.  KDB 377704 can be accessed at https://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/oetcf/kdb/index.cfm.  Note that

be applicable to systems that define fewer than 40 channels.

in 2005, there is no longer a need for Sections 15.307(a) and (c)-(h), which set forth the expired 
coordination requirements.25 Furthermore, because UPCS devices are no longer coordinated by 
UTAM, Inc., the definitions in Section 15.303(b) and (e) that were applicable when UPCS devices were 
either coordinatable or non-coordinatable and the UTAM, Inc.-related labeling requirement in 
Section 15.311 are no longer necessary.26 Thus, we are eliminating Sections 15.303(b) and (e), 15.307(a) 
and (c)-(h), and 15.311 of the rules.
11. We maintain, however, the UTAM, Inc. membership requirement for UPCS-band device 
manufacturers in Section 15.307(b).27 Under the relocation funding plan approved by the Commission, 
UTAM, Inc., acting on behalf of future unlicensed PCS manufacturers in the 1910-1930 MHz band, paid 
to relocate or agreed to share the costs to relocate incumbent services in the band, and future band 
entrants would reimburse it for their share of those incurred costs.  UTAM, Inc. has informed the 
Commission that it has outstanding contractual liabilities from clearing the 1910-1930 MHz band of 
incumbent microwave stations.28 Although UTAM, Inc. expects that the cost-sharing reimbursement(s) 
that it will eventually receive from the AWS licensee(s) of the 1915-1920 MHz band will enable it to pay 
these outstanding liabilities, it must remain in existence until these liabilities are paid.29 UTAM, Inc. 
submits that for it to remain in existence, the Commission cannot eliminate the membership requirement 
because membership fees are its sole source of operating revenue.  UTAM, Inc. argues that if the

27 Under Section 15.307(b), each applicant for FCC equipment authorization of a UPCS-band device must be a 
participating member of UTAM, Inc.  See 47 C.F.R. § 15.307(b).  
28 See UTAM, Inc. Ex Parte comments, filed April 27, 2011, at 2; UTAM, Inc. Ex Parte presentation, filed 
June 6, 2011, at 5.  In 1995, the Commission affirmed its designation of UTAM, Inc. to manage the transition of the 
1910-1930 MHz band from the Private Operational Fixed Microwave Service (POFS) to unlicensed PCS operations.  
See Amendment of the Commission’s Rules to Establish New Personal Communications Services, GEN Docket 
No. 90-314, Fourth Memorandum Opinion and Order, 10 FCC Rcd 7955, 7967 ¶ 38 (1995) (Broadband PCS 
Fourth MO&O).  Some of these POFS operations were paired with links in other spectrum assigned for licensed 
PCS operations.  In some cases, the PCS licensees assumed responsibility for relocating the paired POFS links, and 
UTAM, Inc. agreed to reimburse the PCS licensees a pro rata share for the spectrum cleared in the 1910-1930 MHz 
band.  See UTAM, Inc. Ex Parte comments, filed April 27, 2011, at 2; UTAM, Inc. Ex Parte presentation, filed 
June 6, 2011, at 5.  In 2004, the Commission reallocated the 1910-1920 MHz band from the UPCS for AWS and 
Broadband PCS operations.  As part of this reallocation, the Commission determined that UTAM, Inc. was entitled 
to a reimbursement of 25 percent – on a pro rata basis – of the total costs it had incurred in clearing the 
1910-1930 MHz band of incumbent microwave stations, including any future payment obligations, from future 
AWS licensees in the 1915-1920 MHz AWS-2 band.  See AWS Sixth R&O, 19 FCC Rcd at 20740 ¶ 41, 20745 ¶ 53;

membership requirement were eliminated, it would inequitably place the costs of maintaining 
UTAM, Inc. on existing members, thereby undermining the original purpose of Section 15.307(b) to 
equitably distribute the costs of clearing the 1910-1930 MHz band across the manufacturers producing 
devices that operate in the band.30 As noted above, the Commission determined that cost sharing was 
integral to clearing the UPCS band of incumbent services so new unlicensed devices could be introduced 
in the band.  UTAM, Inc. has made a persuasive case that it has incurred obligations, as a result of the 
UPCS band clearing, that have not been satisfied.  We conclude that, if we were to eliminate the 
membership requirement, there would be no mechanism to ensure that outstanding cost sharing 
obligations are satisfied.  The UPCS Band NPRM proposed no alternative that would equitability 
distribute these obligations among all manufacturers of equipment in the band, including those who 
would introduce new products in the band in the future.  For these reasons, we decide to maintain the 
UTAM, Inc. membership requirement for UPCS-band device manufacturers contained in 
Section 15.307(b).
12. Also, we are correcting the Part 15 UPCS rules to make them consistent with previous 
Commission decisions affecting these rules.  Specifically, we are removing the definition in Section 
15.303(i) that was applicable when asynchronous and isochronous operations were in separate sub-bands; 
amending Section 15.319 to specifically state that both asynchronous and isochronous operations are 
permitted in the 1920-1930 MHz band, consistent with the decision in the AWS Sixth R&O;31 revising 
Section 15.323 to correct a typographical error in the second sentence of paragraph (a); and correcting 
paragraphs (d) and (e) to reference “bands” instead of “sub-bands.”  In addition, we are amending 
Sections 15.31(a)(2) and 15.38(b)(12) of the rules to reference the latest version of the 
ANSI C63.17-2006 standard by which UPCS devices must be measured for compliance with the 
requirements in Part 15 Subpart D of the rules.
13. To help ensure that the UPCS device rules continue to reflect the most appropriate 
industry standards, we delegate to the Chief, Office of Engineering and Technology (OET), the authority 
to approve for use new versions of the ANSI C63.17 standard for methods of measurement of the 
electromagnetic and operational compatibility of UPCS devices to the extent that the changes do not raise 
major compliance issues.  At the same time, we recognize the necessity to provide opportunity for notice 
and comment on any changes or modifications that could affect compliance with our regulations.  
Therefore, in cases where major changes have been made in this standard that could affect compliance, 
the Commission will initiate an appropriate rulemaking proceeding to consider adoption of updated 
versions of the ANSI C63.17 standard.

APPENDIX B
Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
Report and Order in ET Docket No. 10-97   
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, as amended (RFA),1 an Initial Regulatory 
Flexibility Analysis (IRFA) was incorporated in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (Unlicensed 
Personal Communications Service (UPCS) Band NPRM) in ET Docket No. 10-97.2 The Commission 
sought written public comment on the proposals in the UPCS Band NPRM, including comment on the 
IRFA.  This present Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) conforms to the RFA.3
A.  Need for, and Objectives of, the Report and Order
In this Report and Order, the Commission takes steps to improve the operation of unlicensed 
Personal Communications Service (UPCS) devices operating in the 1920-1930 MHz band (known as the 
UPCS band), while limiting the potential for in-band and adjacent-band interference and maintaining 
equal access to the available spectrum on a shared basis for all users.  
In this Report and Order, the objectives of the Commission are to improve the utilization of the 
UPCS band by allowing access to additional usable time and spectrum windows whose use is restricted 
under the current rules, to reduce infrastructure costs through allowing a greater density of UPCS devices 
to be used with fewer base stations, and to allow UPCS devices that use wider bandwidth channels, but 
define fewer than 40 channels, to use the UPCS least-interfered channel access method and access 
additional usable time and spectrum windows.  Specifically, the Commission eliminates the 50 dB above 
thermal noise signal threshold that UPCS devices must monitor when using the least-interfered channel 
access method.  Under this method, UPCS devices would survey the required minimum number of 
channels and use the combined time and spectrum windows with the lowest signal level, instead of using 
only the windows with the lowest signal level below 50 dB above thermal noise.  The Commission also 
reduces from 40 to 20 channels the number of channels a UPCS device must define and monitor in order 
to use the least-interfered channel access method.  In addition, this Report and Order updates the Part 15 
UPCS rules to reflect that UPCS devices no longer need to protect incumbent fixed microwave radio 
stations in the 1920-1930 MHz band and are no longer coordinated by UTAM, Inc., and to make them 
consistent with previous changes to the rules.
B.  Summary of Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments in Response to the IRFA
No public comments were received in response to the IRFA in the UPCS Band NPRM.
  
1 See 5 U.S.C. § 603.  The RFA, see 5 U.S.C. § 601 – 612, has been amended by the Small Business Regulatory 
Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996 (SBREFA), Pub. L. No. 104-121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996), and the Small 
Business Jobs Act of 2010, Public Law No. 111-240, 124 Stat. 2504 (2010).

C. Response to Comments by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration
Pursuant to the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, the Commission is required to respond to any 
comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA), and to 
provide a detailed statement of any change made to the proposed rules as a result of those comments.  The 
Chief Counsel did not file any comments in response to the proposed rules in this proceeding.
D.  Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities to Which the Proposed 
Rule Will Apply.
The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of and, where feasible, an estimate of the 
number of small entities that may be affected by the proposed rules, if adopted.4 The RFA generally 
defines the term "small entity" as having the same meaning as the terms "small business," "small 
organization," and "small governmental jurisdiction." In addition, the term "small business" has the same 
meaning as the term "small business concern" under the Small Business Act.5 A small business concern 
is one which:  (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of operation; and 
(3) satisfies any additional criteria established by the SBA.6
Nationwide, there are a total of approximately 27.5 million small businesses, according to the 
SBA.7  A “small organization” is generally “any not-for-profit enterprise which is independently owned 
and operated and is not dominant in its field.”8 Nationwide, as of 2002, there were approximately 
1.6 million small organizations.9 The term “small governmental jurisdiction” is defined generally as 
“governments of cities, towns, townships, villages, school districts, or special districts, with a population 
of less than fifty thousand.”10 Census Bureau data for 2002 indicate that there were 87,525 local 
governmental jurisdictions in the United States.11 We estimate that, of this total, 84,377 entities were 
“small governmental jurisdictions.”12 Thus, we estimate that most governmental jurisdictions are small.
The changes adopted in this Report and Order affect fixed service (FS) stations licensed under 
Part 101 of our rules, UPCS stations, and wireless equipment manufacturers and frequency coordinators.
  
4 Id. at § 603(b)(3).
5 5 U.S.C. § 601(3) (incorporating by reference the definition of “small business concern” in 15 U.S.C. § 632). 
Pursuant to the RFA, the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an agency, after consultation with the 
Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity for public comment, establishes one or 
more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such definition(s) in 
the Federal Register.”  5 U.S.C. § 601(3).

Fixed Microwave Services. Fixed microwave services include common carrier,13 private 
operational-fixed,14 and broadcast auxiliary radio services.15 At present, there are approximately 
22,015 common carrier fixed licensees and 61,670 private operational-fixed licensees and broadcast 
auxiliary radio licensees in the microwave services.  The Commission has not created a size standard for a 
small business specifically with respect to fixed microwave services.  For purposes of this analysis, the 
Commission uses the SBA small business size standard for the category Wireless Telecommunications 
Carriers (except Satellite), which is 1,500 or fewer employees.16 The Commission does not have data 
specifying the number of these licensees that have no more than 1,500 employees, and thus we are unable 
at this time to estimate with greater precision the number of fixed microwave service licensees that would 
qualify as small business concerns under the SBA’s small business size standard.  Consequently, the 
Commission estimates that there are 22,015 or fewer common carrier fixed licensees and 61,670 or fewer 
private operational-fixed licensees and broadcast auxiliary radio licensees in the microwave services that 
may be small and may be affected by the rules and policies proposed herein.  We note, however, that the 
common carrier microwave fixed licensee category includes some large entities.
Unlicensed Personal Communications Service. As its name indicates, the UPCS is not a 
licensed service.  UPCS consists of intentional radiators operating in the frequency band 1920-1930 MHz 
that provide a wide array of mobile and ancillary fixed communications services to individuals and 
businesses.  The Report and Order affects UPCS operations in the 1920-1930 MHz band; operations in 
those frequencies are given flexibility to deploy both voice and data-based services.  There is no accurate 
source for the number of operators in the UPCS.  Since 2007, the Census Bureau has placed wireless 
firms within the new, broad, economic census category Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except 
Satellite).17 Prior to that time, such firms were within the now-superseded category of “Paging” and 
“Cellular and Other Wireless Telecommunications.”18 Under the present and prior categories, the SBA 
has deemed a wireless business to be small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.19 Census data for 2007, 
which supersede data contained in the 2002 Census, show that there were 1,383 firms that operated that 
year.20 Of those 1,383, 1,368 had fewer than 100 employees, and 15 firms had more than 100 employees.  
  
13 See 47 C.F.R. §§ 101 et seq. for common carrier fixed microwave services (except Multipoint Distribution 
Service).
14 Persons eligible under Parts 80 and 90 of the Commission’s Rules can use Private Operational-Fixed Microwave 
services.  See 47 C.F.R. Parts 80 and 90.  Stations in this service are called operational-fixed to distinguish them 
from common carrier and public fixed stations.  Only the licensee may use the operational-fixed station and only for 
communications related to the licensee’s commercial, industrial, or safety operations.
15 Auxiliary Microwave Service is governed by Part 74 of Title 47 of the Commission’s Rules.  See 47 C.F.R. 
Part 74.  This service is available to licensees of broadcast stations and to broadcast and cable network entities.  
Broadcast auxiliary microwave stations are used for relaying broadcast television signals from the studio to the 
transmitter, or between two points such as a main studio and an auxiliary studio.  The service also includes mobile 
television pickups, which relay signals from a remote location back to the studio.

Thus, under this category and the associated small business size standard, the majority of firms can be 
considered small. 
Wireless Equipment Manufacturers.  This industry is comprised of businesses primarily 
engaged in manufacturing radio, television broadcast, and wireless communications equipment.  
Examples of products made by these establishments are: transmitting and receiving antennas, cable 
television equipment, global positioning system (GPS) equipment, pagers, cellular phones, mobile 
communications equipment, and radio and television studio and broadcasting equipment.21 In this 
category, the SBA has deemed a business manufacturing radio and television broadcasting equipment, 
wireless telecommunications equipment, or both, to be small if it has fewer than 750 employees.22 For 
this category of manufacturing, Census data for 2007 show that there were 919 firms that operated that 
year.  Of those establishments, 531 had between 1 and 19 employees; 240 had between 20 and 99 
employees; and 148 had more than 100 employees.23 Since 771 establishments had fewer than 100 
employees, and since only 148 had more than 100 employees, the vast majority of manufacturers in this 
category would be considered small under applicable standards.  
Frequency Coordinators. Neither the Commission nor the SBA has developed a small business 
size standard specifically applicable to spectrum frequency coordinators.  Since 2007, the Census Bureau 
has placed wireless firms within the new, broad, economic census category Wireless Telecommunications 
Carriers (except Satellite).24 Prior to that time, such firms were within the now-superseded category of 
“Paging” and “Cellular and Other Wireless Telecommunications.”25 Under the present and prior 
categories, the SBA has deemed a wireless business to be small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.26  
Census data for 2007, which supersede data contained in the 2002 Census, show that there were 1,383 
firms that operated that year.  Of those 1,383, 1,368 had fewer than 100 employees, and 15 firms had 
more than 100 employees.27 Thus, under this category and the associated small business standard, the 
majority of firms can be considered small.
E. Description of Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance 
Requirements for Small Entities.
This Report and Order allows additional flexibility for UPCS devices operating in the 
1920-1930 MHz band by eliminating the signal threshold that a UPCS device must monitor when using 
the least-interfered channel access method.  In addition, the Report and Order reduces from 40 to 
20 channels the number of channels that a UPCS device must define and monitor to use the

least-interfered channel access method.  This item does not contain any new reporting or recordkeeping 
requirements.
F. Steps Taken to Minimize Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and 
Significant Alternatives Considered.
The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant alternatives that it has considered in 
reaching its proposed approach, which may include the following four alternatives (among others): 1) the 
establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the 
resources available to small entities; 2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance or 
reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; 3) the use of performance, rather than design, 
standards; and 4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for small entities.28
The Commission’s principal objective in this proceeding is to increase the utilization and 
efficiency of the UPCS band.  By eliminating the signal threshold that a UPCS device must monitor under 
the least-interfered channel access method, we allow UPCS devices to access additional usable combined 
time and spectrum windows in the 1920-1930 MHz band that are restricted from use under the current 
rules.  Our decision to reduce from 40 to 20 channels the number of channels a UPCS device must define 
and monitor to use the least-interfered channel access method will enable UPCS devices that can provide 
advanced cordless technologies and higher data rates to use the least-interfered channel access method 
and access additional usable time and spectrum windows, if available.  Together, these changes will 
increase the utilization and efficiency of the UPCS band and promote the introduction of innovative 
products and services using Internet protocol connectivity to combine access to broadband and telephony 
applications in a new generation of cordless devices.  Elimination of the least-interfered channel 
monitoring threshold will also allow manufacturers to design their devices based on density of devices, 
rather than range, depending on the needs of users, thereby allowing more UPCS devices to operate 
within close proximity to one another, which will reduce the infrastructure costs for a UPCS system.  
Finally, our decision to eliminate rather than just increase the least-interfered channel monitoring 
threshold will provide manufacturers with the flexibility to produce UPCS systems that can operate with 
the maximum possible traffic capacity, which will maximize the utilization of the UPCS band.
Report to Congress: The Commission will send a copy of the Report and Order, including this FRFA, in 
a report to Congress pursuant to the Congressional Review Act.29  In addition, the Commission will send 
a copy of the Report and Order, including this FRFA, to the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the SBA.  A 
copy of the Report and Order and FRFA (or summaries thereof) will also be published in the Federal 
Register.

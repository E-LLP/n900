I. INTRODUCTION
1. Unlicensed TV bands devices, or “TVBDs,” will operate on frequencies in the TV bands 
in areas where they are not used by licensed services (“TV white spaces”).  Although the particular 
unused TV channels vary from location to location, the devices will have the flexibility and agility to 
locate and operate on the unused channels, no matter where the devices are located.  This type of 
“opportunistic use” of spectrum has great potential as a model for enabling access to other spectrum 
bands and improving spectrum efficiency.

2. In this Order, we are addressing five petitions for reconsideration of our decisions in the 
Second Memorandum Opinion and Order (“Second MO&O”) in this proceeding1 and modifying our rules 
in certain respects.  In particular, we are: (1) increasing the maximum height above average terrain 
(HAAT) for sites where fixed devices may operate; (2) modifying the adjacent channel emission limits to 
specify fixed rather than relative levels; and (3) slightly increasing the maximum permissible power 
spectral density (PSD) for each category of TV bands device. These changes will result in decreased 
operating costs for fixed TVBDs and allow them to provide greater coverage, thus increasing the 
availability of wireless broadband services in rural and underserved areas without increasing the risk of 
interference to incumbent services.  We also are revising and amending several of our rules to better 
effectuate the Commission’s earlier decisions in this docket and to remove ambiguities.
II. BACKGROUND
3. In the Second Report and Order and Memorandum Opinion and Order (“Second Report 
and Order”) in this proceeding, the Commission adopted rules that allow unlicensed devices to operate in 
the TV bands at locations where frequencies are not in use by licensed services.2 The TV bands consist of 
six-megahertz channels designated 2 to 51 in four bands of frequencies in the VHF and UHF regions of 
the radio spectrum (54-72 MHz, 76-88 MHz, 174-216 MHz, and 470-698 MHz).3 The Commission 
permitted two categories of unlicensed devices, fixed and personal/portable unlicensed, to operate in the 
TV bands.4  Fixed devices must incorporate a geo-location capability and a means to access a database 
that provides a list of available TV channels that may be used at their location.5 Such devices must 
contact a database to obtain a channel list before operating and re-check the database at least once daily.6  
Fixed devices are permitted to operate with up to one watt transmitter power output and may use an 
antenna that provides up to 6 dBi of gain.7 Portable devices can operate either as “Mode I” or “Mode II”.8  
A Mode II device must incorporate similar geo-location and database access capabilities to fixed devices.9

(“Second MO&O”).  A list of parties filing petitions for reconsideration is included in Appendix A, which also 
includes parties filing oppositions to those petitions and replies to the oppositions.
2 See Second Report and Order and Memorandum Opinion and Order in ET Docket Nos. 02-380 and 04-186, 23 
FCC Rcd 16807 (2008).  In the First Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule Making in this 
proceeding, 21 FCC Rcd 12266 (2006), the Commission allowed fixed unlicensed devices to operate on vacant TV 
channels, excluding channel 37, and prohibited personal/portable devices from operating on channels 14-20 that are 
used by public safety operations in some cities.  However, it did not adopt final technical rules at that time.  In the 
Second Report and Order, the Commission allowed portable devices to operate on channels 21-51, excluding 
channel 37, and adopted technical rules for both fixed and portable devices.  In the Second Memorandum Opinion 
and Order in this proceeding, 25 FCC Rcd 18661 (2010), the Commission responded to seventeen petitions for 
reconsideration of the Second Report and Order.  It upheld the majority of the Commission’s previous decisions but 
made a number of minor revisions to the rules.

A Mode I device is not required to incorporate geo-location or database access capabilities but instead 
obtains the list of available channels on which it can operate from either a fixed or Mode II device that 
has database access.10 Personal/portable devices are permitted to operate with up to 100 mW EIRP except 
when operating on channels adjacent to a TV service, in which case they may operate with up to 40 mW 
EIRP.11 The databases used by TV bands devices are established and administered by parties selected by 
the Commission.12  
4. In the Second MO&O in this proceeding, the Commission upheld the majority of its prior 
decisions but made the following changes to the rules that are at issue in one or more of the five petitions 
for reconsideration that we address in this order:  
§ Restricted fixed TV bands devices from operating at locations where the ground level is more 
than 76 meters above the average terrain level in the area.13
§ Eliminated the requirement that TV bands devices that incorporate geo-location and database 
access must also listen (sense) to detect the signals of TV stations and low power auxiliary 
service stations (wireless microphones).14 As part of that change, the Commission also revised 
the rules in several respects to reflect use of that method as the only means for determining 
channel availability.15 These changes include requiring Mode I devices to verify channel 
availability and Mode II devices to verify their operating location at regular time intervals.16
§ Modified the rules governing the measurement of adjacent channel emissions.17
§ Required that information in the TV bands databases be publicly available.18
5. The petitions for reconsideration raise the following issues: (1) the height above average 
terrain (HAAT) limit for TV bands devices; (2) out-of-band emission limits; (3) protection of wireless 
services on TV channel 52; (4) establishment of a new category of fixed indoor TV bands devices; and (5) 
(Continued from previous page)    
9 See 47 C.F.R. §§ 15.711(b)(2) and 15.711(b)(3)(ii).  Unlike fixed devices, there is no option for a Mode II 
personal/portable device to be professionally installed as an alternative to incorporation of a geo-location capability.  
Additionally, a personal/portable device must re-check its location at least once every 60 seconds except when in a 
sleep mode.

11 See 47 C.F.R. § 15.709(a)(2).
12 See 47 C.F.R. § 15.715.  The Office of Engineering and Technology designated ten entities to administer TV 
bands device databases by two separate Orders.  The ten designated database administrators are: Airity, Inc. 
(formerly WSdb LLC); Comsearch; Frequency Finder, Inc.; Google, Inc.; LS Telcom; Key Bridge Global LLC; 
NeuStar, Inc.; Spectrum Bridge, Inc.; Telcordia Technologies, Inc.; and Microsoft Corporation.  See Order in ET 
Docket Nos. 02-380 and 04-186, 26 FCC Rcd 554 (2011) (designating the first nine of these listed parties as 
database administrators) and Order in ET Docket Nos. 02-380 and 04-186, 26 FCC Rcd 10599 (2011) (designating 
Microsoft Corporation at the tenth database administrator).  At this time, Spectrum Bridge has received approval to 
operate its database system to serve devices and Telcordia has run a public trial of its database system.

III. DISCUSSION
6. We find that in the Second MO&O, the Commission generally established the 
appropriate balance between providing for operation of TV bands devices that will make new broadband 
services available to the public while protecting incumbent services in the TV bands from interference.  
Thus, we are upholding the majority of the Commission’s decisions in the Second MO&O that are 
addressed in the petitions for reconsideration.  We do, however, find merit in some of these requests and 
are therefore modifying certain rules to enhance TVBD operations, particularly in rural and underserved 
areas.  In particular, we are increasing the maximum height above average terrain (HAAT) of sites where 
fixed devices may operate, modifying the adjacent channel (out-of-band) emission limits to specify fixed 
levels, and slightly increasing the maximum permissible power spectral density (PSD) for each category 
of TV bands device. These changes will result in decreased operating costs and greater coverage from 
fixed TV bands devices that we expect will increase the availability of wireless broadband services in 
rural and underserved areas.  We also find that these changes will not increase the risk of interference to 
incumbent services.  We also are correcting several of our rules to better effectuate the Commission’s 
earlier decisions in this docket and to remove ambiguities.  
A. Height above average terrain (HAAT) limit
7. Because the range at which a TV bands device can cause interference to authorized users 
increases as the height of the device’s antenna increases, the Commission adopted a maximum antenna 
height limit of 30 meters above ground level (AGL) for fixed devices in the Second Report and Order.19  
The Commission also adopted a table of separation distances between fixed TV bands devices and the 
service contours of co-channel and adjacent channel TV stations for three different ranges of antenna 
height: 0 to 3 meters, 3 to 10 meters, and 10 to 30 meters.20 This table specifies the greatest separation 
distances at the highest antenna height and shorter separation distances at lower antenna heights. 
8. In the Second MO&O, the Commission declined to increase the maximum permitted 
transmit antenna height above ground for fixed TV bands devices, stating that the 30 meters AGL was 
established as a balance between the benefits of increasing TV bands device transmission range and the 
need to minimize the impact on licensed services.21 However, while the Commission found that 
specifying a limit on antenna height AGL rather than above average terrain would be satisfactory for 
controlling interference to authorized services in the majority of cases, it also recognized that the potential 
for interference increased in instances where a fixed TV bands device antenna is located on a high point 
such as a hill or mountain.22 In such cases, the antenna height above the surrounding terrain would be 
significantly greater than if the antenna were located on flat terrain, thus substantially increasing both the 
distance at which signals would propagate and the potential for interference to authorized operations in 
the TV bands.  The Commission concluded that a limit on antenna height above average terrain (HAAT) 
  
19 See Second Report and Order, 23 FCC Rcd 16807, 16886 (2008) at ¶ 228.  The Commission did not impose 
height restrictions on personal/portable devices because it found that it is not practical to administer an antenna 
height limit for those devices and the lower power and limited antenna gain of personal/portable devices would 
generally result in propagation over a shorter range than fixed devices.
20 See 47 C.F.R. § 15.712(a)(2).
21 See Second MO&O, 25 FCC Rcd 18661, 18689 (2010) at ¶ 65.
22 The antenna height above ground is the distance from the antenna center of radiation to the actual ground directly 
below the antenna.  To calculate the antenna height above average terrain (HAAT), the average elevation of the 
surrounding terrain above mean sea level must be determined along at least 8 evenly spaced radials at distances from 
3 to 16 km from the transmitter site.  The HAAT is the difference between the antenna height above mean sea level 
(the antenna height above ground plus the site elevation) and the average elevation of the surrounding terrain.

was necessary to limit the interference potential of fixed TV bands devices.  To accomplish this, the 
Commission prohibited fixed TV bands devices from operating at sites that are more than 76 meters (249 
feet) above the average height of the surrounding terrain.23 Therefore, the maximum permissible HAAT 
for fixed device antennas is the 76 meter site HAAT limit plus the 30 meter maximum antenna height 
AGL, or 106 meters (348 feet).  To ensure that fixed devices operate only at sites the comply with the 76 
meter HAAT limit, the Commission required that the TV bands database compute the site HAAT at a 
fixed device’s location and not provide a list of available channels to the device if the computed HAAT 
exceeds the limit.24
9. Petitions and Comments. The Wireless Internet Service Providers Association, 
Federation of Internet Solution Providers of the Americas, Native American Broadband Association, 
Spectrum Bridge, Inc., Comsearch, Carlson Wireless Technologies Inc., and Wireless Strategies, Inc. 
(“Joint Petitioners”) request that the Commission eliminate the 76 meter ground HAAT limit for fixed 
sites.25 The Joint Petitioners request that the Commission instead allow antenna heights of up to 250 
meters (820 feet) HAAT.  To offset the increased interference potential from fixed devices operating with 
higher antenna heights, they request that the Commission amend the table of separation distances in 
Section 15.712(a)(2) of the rules to provide increased separation distances from the protected contour of 
co-channel and adjacent channel TV stations for fixed devices operating with antenna heights greater than 
30 meters up to a maximum of 250 meters HAAT.26 The Joint Petitioners argue that there are significant 
areas of the country where fixed devices cannot be deployed solely because the 76 meter ground HAAT 
limit is too low to allow fixed stations to be installed.27 It states that these areas are in rural, mountainous, 
and hilly areas where broadband service to the public is already lacking and where white space spectrum 
would provide an affordable and viable broadband access solution. 
10. In their comments, Stratus Wave, Google, Motorola, PISC, and WCAI support 
eliminating the 76-meter site HAAT limit, arguing that this limit is unnecessarily restrictive.28 Stratus 
Wave states that the current height restrictions foreclose white space operation in the majority of the State 
of West Virginia and that its costs would be reduced by a factor of three if the Commission relaxed these 
restrictions.29 Stratus Wave, Motorola, and WCAI believe fixed devices should be permitted to operate 
with a maximum HAAT of 250 meters.30 WCAI states that this higher limit would benefit ISPs and 
consumers in hilly and mountainous areas and would not harm incumbents if they are protected to the 
same level as afforded by the current table in the rules.31 Google recommends that the Commission 
eliminate the use of HAAT altogether and simply specify a 30-meter antenna height above ground limit, 
but it states that it would support an increase in the maximum HAAT to 250 meters if the Commission 
chooses not to set a height above ground limit.32

11. NAB does not object to a maximum HAAT of 250 meters but believes that the 
Commission should maintain the 30-meter limit on antenna height above ground level.33 Cellular South 
opposes increasing the allowable antenna height for fixed TV bands devices to 250 meters but does not 
oppose allowing an antenna height AGL of no more than 30 meters where the site HAAT exceeds 76 
meters.34 However, Motorola, the Joint Petitioners, and WCAI believe that a 30-meter AGL limit is too 
low.  Motorola argues that the limit unnecessarily penalizes users in flat, rural areas, and the Joint 
Petitioners and WCAI believe the antenna height limit should be raised to 75 meters AGL.35
12. Shure argues that the Joint Petitioner’s proposal to more than triple the limit for fixed TV 
bands device HAAT creates a dramatic imbalance between TVBD transmission range and incumbent 
protections and that for the Joint Petitioner’s proposal to be viable, increased separation distances would 
have to apply to all protected incumbent services.36 Shure did not, however, provide any information on 
what it believes to be the appropriate separation distances.  The Joint Petitioners and Motorola state that 
the Commission should make corresponding increases in the required separation distances to co-channel 
and adjacent channel facilities to compensate for higher HAAT.37 NAB argues that if the Commission 
permits higher HAAT, it should not allow fixed devices at this height to provide channel lists to Mode I 
devices because there may be a greater distance between the fixed and Mode I devices.38
13. Decision. We are modifying our rules to establish a maximum HAAT for a fixed device 
antenna of 250 meters and maintaining the limit for fixed device antenna height AGL at 30 meters. We 
take this action because we find that the current rule, which limits fixed TV bands devices to sites where 
the ground HAAT is no greater than 76 meters, unnecessarily precludes the operation of fixed TV bands 
devices at many locations in the country, particularly in rural and other areas that are currently
underserved by broadband services.  Under the modification we adopt herein, a site with an elevation of 
up to 220 meters above average terrain could be used with a 30-meter antenna, or a site with a higher 
elevation above average terrain could be used with a shorter antenna, provided the sum of the site 
elevation above average terrain and antenna height above ground does not exceed 250 meters.  These 
changes will result in lower costs and greater flexibility for fixed device operators by allowing the use of 
sites that were previously precluded by the rules and permitting greater coverage from each site.  This will 
increase the availability of wireless broadband services, particularly in rural and underserved areas.
14. We decline to raise the limit for fixed device antenna height AGL to 75 meters as the 
Joint Petitioners request.  The Commission previously considered and rejected requests to raise this limit 
in the Second MO&O, noting that the 30-meter height above ground limit was established as a balance 
between increasing the TV bands device transmission range and the need to minimize the impact on 
licensed services.39 While we recognize the Joint Petitioners’ argument that an increased antenna height 
above ground limit could improve TV bands device range in certain circumstances, we find that the 
Commission appropriately took a conservative approach to minimize the potential for interference to 
authorized services by limiting the antenna height AGL to 30 meters.  We therefore decline to increase 
this limit at this time.  As the Commission previously stated, we could revisit this height limit in the

future if experience with TV bands devices indicates they could operate at higher antenna heights without 
causing interference.40 Also, as discussed above, the changes we are making by removing the 76-meter 
site HAAT limit and permitting an antenna HAAT of up to 250 meters will serve to increase the coverage 
of TV bands devices in many instances.
15. Because the range at which interference occurs increases as the antenna height is raised, 
we are making additional changes to offset the increased potential for harmful interference at the higher 
antenna heights we are permitting.  As recommended by the Joint Petitioners, we are revising the table of 
minimum required separation distances between fixed devices and the contours of co-channel and 
adjacent channel TV stations to specify separation distances for HAAT ranging from less than three 
meters to a maximum of 250 meters.41 We find, however, that the Joint Petitioners’ recommended 
separation distances are greater than necessary to provide the level of protection to TV services that the 
Commission decided to provide.42 We are therefore modifying the table as shown and described below.
Required separation (km) from digital or analog TV (full 
service or low power) protected contour
Antenna height above average 
terrain of unlicensed device Co-channel(km) Adjacent channel(km)
Less than 3 meters 4.0 0.4

150-Less than 200 meters 28.5 2.3
200-250 meters 31.2 2.4
16. The methodology used by the Joint Petitioners to calculate the required separation 
distances between TV bands devices and co-channel and adjacent channel TV contours is generally 
consistent with the methodology described in the Second Report and Order.  The Joint Petitioners 
calculated separation distances from fixed devices with an antenna HAAT of 30 meters and greater in the 
same manner as the Commission by using the F(50,10) propagation curves in the rules.43 The Joint 
Petitioners used the OET TM-91-1 method to calculate separation distances for fixed device antenna 
heights below 30 meters HAAT because the Commission’s propagation curves are undefined for HAAT

43 See 47 C.F.R. § 73.699, Figures 9, 9a, 10, 10a, 10b and 10c.  Interfering signal contours are generally calculated 
using the F(50,10) curves.  However, the F(50,10) curves are undefined at distances less than 15 km, so the F(50,50) 
curves are used to compute interfering contours at distances less than 15 km.  The F(50,50) curves are undefined at 
distances less than 1.5 km, so other methods such as OET TM-91-1 must be used at very short distances.

values below 30 meters.44 OET TM-91-1 is a model that the Commission uses for calculating signal 
levels at short distances and low antenna heights above ground.45 While the Commission used a different 
propagation model to calculate the separation distances at low antenna heights in the Second Report and 
Order (the Okumara model), it used the TM-91-1 model in the Second Report and Order to calculate the 
impact of personal/portable TV bands devices on TV reception at short distances, e.g., up to 
approximately 1.5 km.46 Based on our comparison of these models, we find that TM-91-1 is appropriate 
for calculating signal levels at distances less than 1 km (as well as longer distances), whereas the 
Okumura model was not designed for use at distances less than 1 km.  Thus, we agree with the Joint 
Petitioners’ suggestion to use the TM-91-1 model to calculate the required separation distances from TV 
bands devices at antenna heights below 30 meters HAAT where the Commission’s propagation curves are 
undefined.
17. While we agree with the Joint Petitioner’s general methodology for determining 
separation distances, we disagree with certain assumptions it used in its calculations.  First, in 
determining the recommended adjacent channel separation distances, the Joint Petitioners assumed a 
significant increase in the current adjacent channel emission limits which would require substantially 
greater adjacent channel separation distances.  As discussed in more detail below, we decline to 
substantially increase the adjacent channel emission limits.  Second, the Joint Petitioners assumed a -26 
dB D/U adjacent channel protection ratio, whereas the Commission used a -33 dB protection ratio in the 
Second Report and Order.47 As the Commission noted in the Second Report and Order, DTV receivers 
can operate with adjacent channel D/U ratios of -33 dB or even less.48 Therefore, the Joint Petitioners’ 
recommended D/U ratio would overprotect adjacent channel TV service.  We therefore used -33 dB in 
our adjacent channel distance separation calculations.  Third, with regard to co-channel protection, the 
Joint Petitioners assumed a 16 dB D/U protection ratio, whereas the Commission used a 23 dB ratio in the 
Second Report and Order.49 The 23 dB ratio is necessary to protect co-channel DTV service at the edge 
of a TV station’s service contour where the signal-to-noise ratio is low, so we find the Joint Petitioners’ 
recommended co-channel D/U ratio of 16 dB inappropriate.50 Finally, in calculating both the co-channel 
and adjacent channel separation distances, the Joint Petitioners assumed a 3 dB factor for polarization 
mismatch and no correction factor for the TV receive antenna front-to-back ratio, whereas the 
Commission’s calculations did not consider polarization mismatch but assumed a 14 dB antenna front-to-
back ratio as specified in the DTV planning factors.51 We disagree with both of the Joint Petitioners’

stated that it expected the polarization mismatch between a vertically polarized TV bands device antenna and a 
horizontally polarized TV receive antenna to reduce the potential for interference from TV bands devices.  However, 
it did not include a polarization mismatch factor in its calculations of the separation distances between TV bands 
devices and TV service contours.  The 14 dB front-to-back ratio for a TV receive antenna is specified in the DTV 
planning factors that the Commission used for its analysis in the Second Report and Order.  See OET Bulletin No. 
69, Longley-Rice Methodology for Evaluating TV Coverage and Interference, February 6, 2004 at 10.

assumptions in this regard.  We find that it is appropriate for us to consider the antenna front-to-back ratio 
in the calculation because a TV receive antenna near the edge of a service contour will be pointed at the 
TV station being received, so the back of the antenna will be pointing toward a TV bands device located 
outside the service contour.  We do not agree that use of a polarization mismatch factor is appropriate for 
determining fixed device separation distances because manufacturers have the freedom to design systems 
that use either horizontally or vertically polarized antennas, so we cannot assume or rely upon a 
polarization mismatch between TV bands devices and TV receive antennas.
18. We recalculated both the co-channel and adjacent channel separation distances in the 
Joint Petitioners’ table using the TM-91-1 model and methodology described above, assuming a DTV 
protected contour of 41 dBu.  In calculating the revised separation distances, we discovered an error in the 
co-channel separation distances in the current rules.  While the Second Report and Order stated that the 
separation distances were determined using the maximum fixed device EIRP of 4 watts, we had 
inadvertently calculated the distances using an effective radiated power (ERP) of 4 watts, which is 
equivalent to 6.56 watts EIRP.  The use of this higher power in the calculations resulted in the 
determination of co-channel separation distances that are greater than necessary to provide the degree of 
protection to TV service that the Commission decided to provide.52 Using the methodology described 
above and the correct EIRP to calculate the required separation distances, at antenna heights up to 30 
meters the required co-channel separation distances are reduced by approximately 2 to 3 kilometers as 
compared to the current rules, while the required adjacent channel separation distances increase by 
approximately 300 to 500 meters as compared to the current rules. 
19. We are prohibiting fixed devices with an HAAT greater than the current maximum of 
106 meters from providing channel lists to Mode I personal/portable devices.  This action is necessary 
because a Mode I device, which does not incorporate a geo-location capability, obtains a list of available 
channels from a fixed or Mode II device that is determined by the geographic coordinates of those 
devices.  Under the current 106 meter limitation, the communication distance between a Mode I device 
and the fixed or Mode II device that provides a channel list is relatively short, and thus there is a low 
probability that a Mode I device will operate at a location where its channel list is not valid, i.e., does not 
meet the minimum separation distances from co-channel and adjacent channels TV stations or other 
protected services.  However, if the fixed device that obtains the channel list for a Mode I device operates 
with greater HAAT than the current rules permit, the Mode I device could operate at a greater distance 
from the coordinates of the fixed device where the available channel list was calculated.  This will 
increase the chance that the Mode I device could operate at a location where the channel list is not valid.  
We will therefore require that the TV bands database not provide channel lists for Mode I devices through 
fixed devices with an antenna HAAT of greater than 106 meters.53  
20. We are not increasing the minimum required separation of one kilometer between 
wireless microphones and fixed devices operating at a higher HAAT than the current rules allow, because 
the higher HAAT will not increase fixed device signal strength at a one kilometer distance.  The OET 
TM-91-1 model that we use to calculate signal strength at that distance takes into account radiated power, 
separation distance, and the antenna height AGL, but is independent of the HAAT.54 Because we are not 
  
52 See 47 C.F.R. § 15.712(a)(1).
53 A Mode I device requests a list of available channels through either a fixed or a Mode II personal/portable device.  
The fixed or Mode II personal/portable device sends the Mode I FCC identification number to the database for 
verification and requests a list of available channels.  The database will enforce the height limit we are adopting by 
not providing a list of available channels to a Mode I device if the request comes through a fixed device with an 
HAAT greater than 106 meters.  The database calculates the HAAT of all fixed devices, so it has the information 
necessary to determine compliance with this height limit.

increasing the maximum fixed device antenna height AGL or radiated power, there will be no increase in 
signal level at one kilometer.  We also are not increasing the size of the exclusion zones around receive 
sites for MVPDs, low power TV or BAS links, because we have no information demonstrating that the 
existing requirements are insufficient to provide adequate protection at the higher antenna HAAT that we 
are permitting for fixed devices.
B. Out-of-band emissions
21. In the Second Report and Order, the Commission adopted out-of-band emission limits 
for TV bands devices to protect other authorized services both inside and outside the TV bands.  For 
emissions that fall in a TV channel adjacent to the operating channel of a TV bands device, the 
Commission required that these emissions be at least 55 dB below the highest emission in the operating 
channel, with both the in-band and out-of-band emissions measured with a 100 kHz bandwidth.55  
Emissions that are more than one channel removed from the operating channel must comply with the 
limits specified in Section 15.209 of the rules.56 These field strength limits, measured at a distance of 3 
meters, are 100 microvolts per meter (30-88 MHz), 150 microvolts per meter (88-216 MHz), 200 
microvolts per meter (216-960 MHz), and 500 microvolts per meter (above 960 MHz).  
22. In the Second MO&O, the Commission modified the limits for emissions that fall in TV 
channels adjacent to the operating channel.  Specifically, it required that in-band emissions be measured 
within a 6 MHz bandwidth instead of within a 100 kHz bandwidth, and it revised the required level of 
attenuation from 55 dB to 72.8 dB to compensate for the difference in measurement bandwidths while 
providing the same level of interference protection.57 The Commission made these changes to ensure 
consistency in emission measurements, because the in-band power measured within a 100 kHz bandwidth 
could vary depending on the bandwidth of the transmitted signal, whereas the total power measured 
within a 6 MHz bandwidth will be the same regardless of whether the signal fills the entire channel or just 
part.58
23. Petitions and Comments.  The Joint Petitioners, Motorola, and Wi-Fi Alliance request 
that the Commission relax the emissions limit in the channel immediately adjacent to the TV bands device 
operating channel.  Motorola recommends relaxing the limit by 25 dB for frequencies +/-3 MHz outside 
the channel where a fixed TV bands device operates and increasing the adjacent channel separation 
distances by a sufficient amount to introduce an additional 25 dB of path loss.59 It states that the relaxed 
emission mask could apply to all fixed devices or alternatively to a new class of fixed device that would 
have to meet increased adjacent channel separation distances.  Motorola argues that the emission mask for 
devices operating in the TV bands is 30-40 dB more stringent than the industry standards for Wi-Fi and 
WIMAX technologies.60 It states that this results in equipment costs for fixed customer premises 
equipment that are 65% higher compared to comparable equipment operating in other frequency bands.  
Motorola further argues that the emission limits impact network capacity and data throughput because

56 Id.
57  See Second MO&O, 25 FCC Rcd 18661, 18697 (2010) at ¶ 87. An increase in the in-band measurement 
bandwidth to 6 MHz will result in a measured level that is 17.8 dB greater than the level measured in a 100 kHz 
bandwidth if the TV band device power is uniformly distributed across a channel.  Therefore, required attenuation in 
the adjacent channel was changed from 55 dB to 72.8 dB (17.8 dB greater) to provide the same level of interference 
protection.

part of a 6 MHz channel will need to be used as a transition band to meet the required level of suppression 
at the channel edge.61 It states that a relaxed emission mask for fixed devices, coupled with a greater 
distance separation from adjacent channel TV stations, can provide equivalent protection to incumbent 
services.  The Joint Petitioners state in their petition that they agree with the changes requested by 
Motorola.62 The Wi-Fi Alliance recommends that the Commission adopt a fixed adjacent channel 
emission limit of -25.8 dBm/100 kHz for devices with a transmitted power of 100 mW EIRP or less.63 It 
argues that expensive and complex filtering must be added to devices to meet the out-of-band emission 
limits, although it does not quantify the claimed increase in equipment cost.  
24. Google and PISC support the petitioners’ request to modify the adjacent channel 
emission limits. Google contends that adjusting the out-of-band emission limits could speed deployment 
of white spaces products and services by making it easier for manufacturers to build products and bring 
them to market.64 PISC agrees that the Commission should modify the emission mask for fixed TV bands 
devices, which it claims is overly restrictive.65
25. Several parties argue that relaxation of the adjacent channel emission limits will result in 
interference to authorized services.  NCTA states that the Commission should reject the petitions to relax 
the limits, arguing that the proposed higher limits are not sufficient to protect over-the-air reception.66
Cellular South argues that the Commission should decline to relax the out-of-band emission mask for TV 
bands devices without ensuring protection for Lower Block A wireless systems (which occupy former TV 
channel 52).67 NAB and Shure state that the requested relaxation of the limits would cause interference to 
TV reception and wireless microphones, and Shure further argues that increased separation distances from 
adjacent channel TV stations will not prevent interference to wireless microphones.68 Motorola counters 
that the requested changes would not cause interference if separation distances are increased and that 
Shure grossly overstates the concern for interference to wireless microphones which can operate adjacent 
to TV stations, which operate at much higher power than fixed TVBDs.69 The Joint Petitioners state that 
the Commission could increase the 1 km zone for wireless microphones, enlarge the protected area for 
cable headends, or retain the current out-of-band emission limit at channel 51.70  
26. NAB argues that claims that compliance with the emissions mask would be difficult and 
costly are undermined by Adaptrum’s March 8, 2011 ex parte filing demonstrating that it can comply 
with the mask.71 It also argues that compliance with the emission mask is easier for fixed devices than 
portable devices because they have few physical restrictions regarding size and weight.72  NAB and Shure

also argue that the petitions to modify the adjacent channel emission limits are procedurally defective 
because the Commission already considered and rejected similar requests in the Second MO&O.73
Motorola disagrees, arguing that the Commission is not required to dismiss a petition that requests 
changes that were previously considered and rejected.74  
27. Spectrum Bridge filed ex parte comments on November 14, 2011 recommending changes 
to the rules concerning the adjacent channel emission limits and the power spectral density (PSD) limits.75  
Specifically, it requested that we increase the maximum permissible spectral density for fixed devices 
from 12.2 dBm/100 kHz to 18.2 dBm/100 kHz and establish a single adjacent channel emission limit of 
-42.8 dBm for fixed devices.  It stated that an increase in the PSD limit is necessary to allow for roll-off to 
meet the adjacent channel emission limits and that an adjacent channel emission limit that is independent 
of the device power would eliminate the situation where a decrease in the in-band power requires a 
decrease in the adjacent channel power to meet a relative emission limit.  Spectrum Bridge also stated that 
the database could determine the appropriate separation distances from protected services if the 
Commission provides flexibility in the PSD and adjacent channel emission limits, although it did not 
clearly describe how this would be accomplished.
28. Decision. We are modifying the rules for adjacent channel emission limits to specify 
fixed values, rather than vary the limit relative to the in-band power.  Specifically, we are adopting a fixed 
adjacent channel emission limit for each category of TV bands device that is equivalent to the current 
emission limit for devices operating at maximum power.  Devices operating at less than the maximum 
permitted power will not be required to suppress emissions below the fixed limits we are establishing.  
This eliminates the need for a device operating at less than the maximum permitted power to 
unnecessarily suppress adjacent channel emissions below the levels needed to prevent interference to 
other services in the TV bands, thus simplifying equipment design and reducing its cost.  A fixed 
emission limit also simplifies compliance measurements, because the emission level can be measured 
directly rather than by comparing the in-band and adjacent channel power measured in two different 
bandwidths.
29. We calculate the appropriate fixed adjacent channel emission limits as follows.  The 
current adjacent channel emission limit is -72.8 dB in a 100 kHz bandwidth, measured relative to the total 
in-band power in a 6 MHz bandwidth.76 We are defining a fixed adjacent channel emission limit for each 
of the four maximum power levels at which TV bands devices can operate (fixed: 1 Watt; 
personal/portable: 100 mW; personal/portable operating adjacent to occupied channels: 40 mW; and 
sensing-only devices: 50 mW).  The adjacent channel emission limit for each category of device is simply 
the maximum power permitted in a 6 MHz bandwidth minus 72.8 dB.  A table showing these limits is 
provided below.
30. We also are slightly increasing the maximum permissible PSD for each category of TV 
bands device to address the roll-off concern raised by Spectrum Bridge.  We established the PSD limits to 
prevent multiple TV bands devices with transmit bandwidths of much less than 6 MHz from sharing a 
channel, which could result in a total transmitted power within a channel significantly greater than the 
  
73 See NAB opposition at 3 and Shure reply to oppositions at 2.
74 See Motorola reply to oppositions at 4.
75 See Spectrum Bridge ex parte comments dated November 14, 2011.  Power spectral density is a measure of the 
transmitter power within a specified bandwidth, which is defined as 100 kHz for TV bands devices.  
76 The current adjacent channel emission limit is -72.8 dB relative to the in-band power in a 6 MHz bandwidth, 
which is equivalent to -55 dB relative to the maximum in-band power in a 100 kHz bandwidth, when adjusted to 
compensate for the difference between measurement bandwidths.  The adjacent channel emissions are measured in a 
100 kHz bandwidth.
Federal Communications Commission FCC 12-36
13
limits for individual fixed or personal/portable devices.77 These limits were derived using the assumption 
that the maximum permitted power of a TV bands device is spread uniformly across a 6 MHz channel.  
However, we recognize that this assumption makes compliance with either the current or the modified 
adjacent channel emission limits we are adopting impractical if a device operates at the maximum 
permissible power level.  For a TV bands device to operate at the maximum permissible power, it must 
fill the entire 6 MHz channel, leaving no margin for a roll-off from the in-band signal to the much lower 
level it must meet in the adjacent channel.  We are therefore increasing the PSD limit for each category of 
TV bands device by 0.4 dB, which will allow a TV bands device to operate at the maximum permissible 
power in a bandwidth of 5.5 MHz instead of 6 MHz.  This will allow 250 kHz for a roll-off from the in-
band signal to each adjacent channel.  We are not adopting a 6 dB (4 times) increase in the PSD limit as 
Spectrum Bridge suggests, because that change would allow devices to operate at maximum power in a 
bandwidth of much less than 6 MHz, thus making it possible for multiple devices to share a channel with 
a total power greater than the limits currently allowed for an individual device.
31. The revised PSD and adjacent channel emission limits that we are adopting are as follows.
Type of TV bands device Power limit (6 MHz) PSD limit (100 kHz) Adjacent channel limit (100 kHz)
Fixed 30 dBm (1 Watt) 12.6 dBm -42.8 dBm
Personal/portable (adj. channel) 16 dBm (40 mW) -1.4 dBm -56.8 dBm
Sensing only 17 dBm (50 mW) -0.4 dBm -55.8 dBm
All other personal/portable 20 dBm (100 mW) 2.6 dBm -52.8 dBm
32. In our review of the PSD and adjacent channel emission issues, we discovered some 
minor inconsistencies and omissions in the rules concerning the measurement of emissions and are 
correcting them herein.  Specifically, Section 15.709(c) does not specify whether compliance with the 
adjacent channel emission limits is determined through radiated or conducted measurements.  In addition, 
Section 15.709(a)(5) requires measurement of the power conducted from the TV bands device into the 
antenna to determine compliance with the PSD limits.  However, this is not possible for personal/portable 
devices which are required to have a permanently attached antenna.  This section also does not include a 
requirement that fixed device PSD must be reduced in the same manner as the maximum conducted 
output power when the transmit antenna gain exceeds 6 dBi.78 Such a requirement is necessary to ensure 
that the PSD is proportionally reduced when the maximum output power is reduced to prevent a device 
from transmitting in a bandwidth of much less than 5.5 MHz at the maximum permissible power level. To 
correct these omissions and inconsistencies, we are revising Sections 15.709(a) and (c) to specify that the 
PSD and adjacent channel emission limits are conducted power limits for fixed devices and EIRP 
(radiated) limits for personal/portable devices.  We are also requiring that the conducted PSD limit for 
fixed devices be reduced by one dB for each dB that the maximum directional gain of the transmit 
antenna exceeds 6 dBi.  These rule clarifications will not result in any increased compliance costs for 
equipment manufacturers.
33. We decline to relax the out-of-band emission limit to the specific values requested by 
Motorola, the Joint Petitioners, and the Wi-Fi Alliance.  As the Commission previously noted in the 
Second MO&O, adjacent channel emissions from a TV bands device appear as co-channel emissions in an 
  
77 See Second MO&O, 25 FCC Rcd 18661, 18695 (2010) at ¶ 82.
78 See 47 C.F.R. § 15.709(a).  This section requires a one dB power reduction for each dB that the maximum antenna 
gain exceeds 6 dBi.
Federal Communications Commission FCC 12-36
14
adjacent channel used by a TV station or other authorized service, and interference can occur to TV 
reception at very low undesired co-channel signal levels.79 The Commission also noted that 
personal/portable TV bands devices are permitted to operate within the protected contours of adjacent 
channel TV stations, and fixed TV bands devices can operate as close as 0.1 kilometers outside the 
contours of adjacent channel stations and at significantly higher power than personal/portable TV bands 
devices.80 Thus, we find it appropriate to require TV bands devices to meet tighter adjacent channel 
emission limits than other equipment such as Wi-Fi devices that do not typically operate adjacent to 
services that receive interference at the same low level as the broadcast TV service.  We note that the 
relaxation of the limit requested by the petitioners is approximately 25 dB (316 times the power), which 
would be a very significant increase in adjacent channel power over the maximum the rules currently 
permit and would have the potential to cause interference to adjacent channel users in the TV bands.  
34. We find that increasing the minimum separation distances between TV bands devices and 
adjacent channel TV stations as a way to offset the increased interference potential would be effective 
only in protecting TV reception but not other services that operate in or adjacent to the TV bands.  For 
example, registered wireless microphones and other low power auxiliary services authorized under Part 
74 would be impacted by the increased noise that TV bands devices would place in adjacent channels.  
This increased noise also could limit the use of personal/portable TV bands devices operating adjacent to 
fixed TV bands devices, thereby impairing efficient use of spectrum.  Increasing the 1 kilometer 
protection distance around registered wireless microphones would be ineffective because registration 
provides only co-channel and not adjacent channel protection from TV bands devices.  Further, the 
increased adjacent channel emission levels could impact wireless services adjacent to the TV bands, such 
as those above channel 51 (the subject of another petition discussed in detail below), land mobile radio 
services on frequencies below channels 7 and 14, and the Low Power Radio Service above channel 13.  
35. For the reasons stated above, we decline to relax the adjacent channel emission limits to 
prevent interference to authorized services in and adjacent to the TV bands. We conclude that our 
decision on this issue promotes more efficient use of the TV spectrum by both licensed and unlicensed 
devices.  We recognize the petitioners’ argument that tighter emission limits could result in higher 
equipment costs.  We find, however, that the record in this proceeding indicates that at least one 
equipment manufacturer, Adaptrum, is capable of building a prototype device that complies with the 
limits adopted in the Second MO&O.81 In addition, another manufacturer, Koos Technical Services, Inc., 
developed a device that complies with all the requirements for fixed TV bands devices, including the 
adjacent channel emission limits, and became the first party to obtain certification for a TV bands 
device.82 Further, tighter out-of-band emission limits can allow users to operate in adjacent frequency 
bands with less geographic separation between them, thus enabling more efficient and intensive use of 
spectrum.  Thus, we conclude that the benefits of tighter out-of-band emission limits outweigh any 
increase in equipment cost that may be necessary to comply with these rules.
C. Protection of wireless services on channel 52
36. Prior to the June 12, 2009 digital television transition, full-service TV stations were 
permitted to operate on channels 52-69 (698 MHz to 806 MHz, also referred to as the 700 MHz band).  
The Commission reallocated these channels for services other than broadcast television.  Under the band

plan that the Commission adopted, there are two channel groupings: 1) the lower 700 MHz band, 
consisting of channels 52-59, and 2) the upper 700 MHz band, consisting of channels 60-69.83 The lower 
700 MHz band is divided into five blocks designated A through E, and the upper 700 MHz band is 
divided into four blocks designated A through D, with two additional bands allocated for public safety 
use.  Block A in the lower 700 MHz band, which is the subject of Cellular South’s petition for 
reconsideration in this proceeding, consists of TV channel 52 paired with TV channel 57.  This pairing of 
channels with a 30 MHz frequency separation between them is designed to allow the use of these 
channels for two-way wireless operations.  Fixed base stations will transmit to mobile devices using 
channel 57, while mobile devices will transmit to base stations using channel 52.  Therefore, base stations 
will incorporate receivers that receive signals from mobile devices on channel 52.  The lower 700 MHz 
Block A was licensed through Commission Auction 73 in 2008.84 Cellular South is one of the entities 
that obtained licenses for Block A through this auction.  It did not previously participate in this 
proceeding.
37. Prospective bidders were made aware prior to Auction 73 that there would continue to be 
full-service and low power television stations on channel 51 after the auction.  The Public Notice 
describing this auction’s procedures cautioned potential bidders about Commission rules and 
requirements that place limits on the ability of 700 MHz band licensees to use this spectrum.85 The Public 
Notice specifically pointed to Section 27.60 of the rules that requires wireless licensees to protect co-
channel and adjacent channel TV stations, including stations on channel 51.86 Thus, prospective bidders 
for Block A were given notice that there would be TV stations on adjacent channel 51, and the emission 
levels that a TV station may place in an adjacent channel are clearly specified in the Commission’s 
rules.87 These limits permit TV stations to place significantly higher power in an adjacent channel than 
Part 15 TV bands devices.88  
38. CTIA – the Wireless Association and the Rural Cellular Association filed a petition for 
rule making and a licensing freeze on March 15, 2011, requesting that the Commission take action to 
prevent further interference to Block A licensees.89 To permit the Commission to evaluate the matters 
raised in the petition, the Media Bureau placed a freeze on the filing of new applications and most

87 See 47 C.F.R. § 73.622(h).
88 Section 73.622(h) requires attenuation of TV station emissions in the adjacent channel ranging from 47 dB in the 
500 kHz segment closest to the TV station channel to 110 dB at the edge of the adjacent channel furthest from the 
TV station channel.  These emissions are measured in a 500 kHz bandwidth and compared to the average 
transmitted power in the 6 MHz TV channel.  Digital TV stations may operate at hundreds of kilowatts effective 
radiated power (ERP) on channel 51 as compared to fixed TV bands devices that can operate with a maximum of 2.4 
watts ERP.  Also, TV stations have a less stringent adjacent channel emission suppression requirement than TV 
bands devices over part of the adjacent channel.  Thus, a TV station on channel 51 could produce emissions on 
channel 52 that are over a million times (60 dB) greater than those from a TV bands device on channel 51.

applications for minor changes to low power and full power television stations on channel 51.90 The 
Commission took that action to preserve the status quo and to ensure that new applications are not filed in 
anticipation of the future limitations proposed in the petition.  It has not yet taken any other action with 
respect to this petition.
39. Petitions and Comments.  Cellular South argues in its petition that the Commission 
should modify the TV bands device rules to provide additional protection for wireless services operating 
adjacent to TV channel 51 in the lower 700 MHz Block A, i.e., on channel 52.  Specifically, it argues that 
the Commission should: 1) prohibit all fixed TV bands device operation on TV channel 51, 2) limit the 
power of personal/portable TV bands devices on channel 51 to 40 milliwatts, 3) permit the registration of 
lower 700 MHz Block A base stations in the TV bands database and require a minimum separation 
distance of 0.1 kilometers between personal/portable devices and Block A base stations.91 Cellular South 
states that these steps will provide lower 700 MHz Block A wireless systems with protection equivalent 
to that granted to other TV band incumbents.  
40. Cellular South argues that it could not have previously participated in this proceeding 
because at the time the Second Report and Order was released, equipment for the lower 700 MHz 
spectrum was not available, so it was impossible to know whether interference from TV bands devices 
would be likely to occur.92 It claims that the facts presented in its petition were unknown to it prior to the 
time for filing petitions for reconsideration of the Second Report and Order and that these facts could not 
have been discovered with the exercise of due diligence.  Cellular South requests that the Commission 
consider its petition for reconsideration despite not having previously participating in this proceeding.  It 
argues that the facts presented in its petition raise substantial public interest concerns because they relate 
to the potential for destructive interference to operations in the lower 700 MHz Block A from TV bands 
devices.  Cellular South claims that due to these public interest concerns, the Commission is obligated to 
consider its petition without regard to whether the facts in them could have been presented on 
reconsideration of the Second Report and Order.
41. The Wi-Fi Alliance, Motorola, and WISPA support allowing the registration of lower 700 
MHz Block A base stations in the TV bands database and establishing protection criteria to prevent 
interference to these stations.93 However, these parties oppose Cellular South’s request for a blanket 
prohibition on fixed devices operating on channel 51.  
42. PISC argues that the Commission should reject Cellular South’s request to limit the use 
of channel 51 as untimely and overly restrictive.94 It states that Cellular South was aware when it 
purchased its licenses in 2008 that it had no protection from interference from users operating on adjacent 
channel 51 and for that reason paid a lower price for its spectrum.95 PISC argues that Cellular South 
could have participated previously in the TV white spaces proceeding but failed to do so.96 It states that if

the Commission decides to adopt interference protection rules for lower 700 MHz Block A base stations, 
it could require a well-defined exclusion zone around registered stations rather than nationwide 
restrictions.97
43. Cellular South disagrees with parties that argue that fixed TV bands devices should be 
permitted to operate on channel 51.  It states that commenting parties all agree that lower 700 MHz Block 
A licensees would suffer interference without additional protection and support including base stations in 
the database.98 Cellular South argues that providing protection to lower 700 MHz Block A licensees that 
is equivalent to TV station protection requires prohibiting operation by fixed devices on channel 51, 
which is an adjacent channel to the lower 700 MHz band Block A.99 It states that lower Block A systems 
will be built throughout the United States and that their aggregate protected service contours will cover 
the entire country.100 Cellular South argues that the protection distance from lower 700 MHz Block A 
licensees should be at least 51 km, which is the same separation required from PLMRS systems 
authorized under waivers.  It states that once lower 700 MHz Block A systems are built out, there are 
likely to be few locations more than 51 km from base stations.101
44. Decision. We decline to establish in this docket new requirements to protect wireless 
operations on channel 52.  As an initial matter, we note that Cellular South’s petition on this issue is not 
timely filed.  The Commission adopted rules permitting TV band devices to operate on Channel 51 in its 
2008 Second Report and Order.102 Pursuant to Section 1.429(d) of the Commission’s rules,103 the 
deadline for seeking reconsideration of that decision was 30 days after the summary of the Second Report 
and Order was published in the Federal Register. Cellular South filed its petition in January 2011, more 
than two years after the applicable due date.
45. As an independent and alternative basis, we dismiss Cellular South’s petition on this 
issue pursuant to Section 1.429(b) of the Commission’s rules, which precludes parties from relying on 
facts in petitions for reconsideration that were not presented to the Commission previously, unless those 
facts have changed or the party could not have known about those facts when it had an opportunity to 
comment.104 No party raised the issue of protection criteria for services on channel 52 in response the 
Notice or Further Notice in this proceeding or at any time prior to Cellular South’s petition for 
reconsideration.  We are not persuaded that Cellular South could not previously participate in this 
proceeding.  It purchased its licenses at auction in 2008, several months before the adoption of the Second 
Report and Order, and over two years before the adoption of the Second MO&O.  Cellular South 
therefore had ample opportunity to make any concerns about potential interference from TV bands 
devices to wireless services in the lower 700 MHz Block A known to the Commission but failed to do so.  
While we recognize its argument that the final technical specifications for 700 MHz band equipment were 
not available until more recently, we do not find that a convincing explanation for not participating in the 
proceeding.  If the precise technical parameters needed to perform an interference analysis are not known 
(e.g., receiver bandwidth, noise floor, noise figure, antenna gain, and desired-to-undesired signal ratio),

parties can make reasonable estimates of these parameters.  Cellular South, however, did not provide any 
analysis or even express to the Commission any general concerns about possible interference prior to 
filing its petition for reconsideration.
46. As another independent and alternative basis for dismissing the petition on this issue, we 
reach the merits and rule against Cellular South.  We find that there is no need to adopt new requirements 
as Cellular South requests because the current rules appropriately protect wireless operations on channel 
52.  The emission levels that a TV bands device may place in an adjacent channel are far below the levels 
that a full-service TV station on channel 51 may place in adjacent channel 52.  Specifically, emissions 
from TV bands devices in the adjacent channel must be at least 72.8 dB below the level in the 6 MHz 
channel where the TV bands device operates.  As discussed above, we are modifying the rules to specify 
maximum adjacent channel emission levels that provide this level of adjacent channel protection.  For a 
personal/portable TV bands device operating on channel 51 at the maximum allowable power of 100 
milliwatts EIRP, the maximum radiated emission in the adjacent channel would be -52.8 dBm EIRP or 
132 microvolts per meter at a distance of three meters.  This is below the Section 15.209 out-of-band 
emission limit of 200 microvolts per meter at three meters that applies to most Part 15 transmitters in this 
frequency band.  In the case of fixed TV bands devices operating on channel 51 at the maximum EIRP of 
4 watts, the maximum permitted emission in the adjacent channel is -36.8 dBm EIRP or 835 microvolts 
per meter at three meters.105 While this is greater than the Section 15.209 limit, we note that this limit 
was developed with the assumption that there would be a 10 meter separation between a potentially 
interfering device and the device being protected.106 We expect that there would typically be a much 
greater separation distance between a TV bands device and a wireless base station receiving channel 52, 
thus significantly reducing the signal level at the receiver and the likelihood of interference. 107 Thus, we 
find that there is a very low probability that TV bands devices on channel 51 will cause harmful 
interference to wireless services in the adjacent band.  Because we are not adopting here protection 
criteria between TV bands devices and Block A stations, we see no reason to include 700 MHz Block A 
base stations in the TV bands databases.
47. While the Part 15 rules are designed to minimize the likelihood of interference to 
authorized services, there is always the possibility that interference may occur in certain situations.  
Therefore TV bands devices, like all other Part 15 devices, operate on a non-interference basis, meaning 
that in the event a device causes interference to an authorized service, the device must cease operation.108  
Because fixed TV bands devices must be registered in the TV bands database, if a licensee of a wireless 
system were to receive interference, it could check the database to find information on the interfering 
device.  Also, as the Commission stated in the Second Report and Order, we intend to closely oversee the 
development and introduction of TV bands devices and take whatever actions may be necessary to correct 
any interference that may occur and will consider any rule changes that might be needed to better protect 
against harmful interference to incumbent services.109 Because TV bands devices operate under the 
control of a database that provides a list of available channels to the TV bands devices, in the event of 
harmful interference the Commission could take steps such as requesting the database operators to limit 
  
105 For a fixed device, the maximum radiated power in the adjacent channel would be -42.8 dBm (conducted into the 
antenna) plus 6 dB for the antenna gain, producing an EIRP of -36.8 dBm.
106 See First Report and Order in Docket 20780, 46 RR2d 473 (1979) at Appendix C.
107 We also note that fixed devices and personal portable devices with power levels greater than 40 mW may 
operate on channel 51 only in locations where no TV station operates on adjacent channel 50, thus reducing the 
number of locations where higher power TV bands devices could operate in close proximity to Block A base 
stations.

the use of certain TV channels in an area.  Thus, we find no need to adopt new protection requirements 
for wireless services on channel 52 at this time.
D. New class of TV bands devices
48. As discussed above, the rules that the Commission adopted in the Second Report and 
Order allow for two classes of TV bands devices – fixed and personal/portable.110 Fixed devices may 
operate at power levels up to 4 watts EIRP and must either incorporate a geo-location capability such as 
GPS or be professionally installed and have the devices’ geographic coordinates manually entered by the 
installer.111 Personal/portable devices may operate with a power level up to 100 mW EIRP.  Mode II 
personal/portable devices must incorporate a geo-location capability such as GPS to determine the 
geographic coordinates to within +/- 50 meters.112 Both fixed and Mode II portable devices must access a 
database that provides a list of available channels at the devices’ location.113 A Mode II portable device 
must re-check its location and the database for available channels if it changes location during 
operation.114  Mode I devices are not required to incorporate geo-location or database access capabilities, 
and they obtain a list of available channels on which they can operate from either a fixed or Mode II 
device that accesses a database.115 A portable device can operate in Mode II at locations where it can 
receive a geo-location signal, and in Mode I at locations where it cannot.  Fixed devices may operate only 
on vacant TV channels that are not adjacent to occupied TV channels, while personal/portable devices 
may operate adjacent to occupied TV channels if their maximum EIRP is reduced to no more than 40 
milliwatts.116  
49. In the Second MO&O, the Commission decided that a Mode II device must use its geo-
location capability to check its location at least once every 60 seconds while in operation to determine 
whether it has moved.117 In addition, the Commission required that a Mode II device check the database 
when it moves more than 100 meters from the location where it performed its last database check.118
50. Petitions and Comments.  The Wi-Fi Alliance argues that a significant class of mass 
market Mode II personal/portable devices will be precluded because they are stationary and operate 
indoors and will be unable to reliably determine their geographic coordinates to within the limits specified 
in the rules.119 It requests that the Commission modify the rules to allow a new class of indoor fixed 
devices that operate at the same power level as Mode II personal/portable devices and that are permitted 
to operate adjacent to occupied TV channels.120 The Wi-Fi Alliance does not specifically address whether 
this new class of device would need to incorporate geo-location capability.  However, because it requests
that they be classified as fixed devices, the current rules would permit manufacturers the option of 
specifying professional installation in place of incorporating a geo-location technology such as GPS.

51. NAB, Shure, and NCTA oppose the Wi-Fi Alliance’s petition.  NAB argues that the 
intent of the Wi-Fi Alliance’s request is to circumvent the requirement that low power devices used at 
fixed locations include a geo-location capability.121 Shure argues that a new class of indoor fixed devices 
will cause interference to wireless microphones on adjacent channels and that the devices the Wi-Fi 
Alliance describes should be classified as portable devices and meet the portable device requirements.122  
NCTA believes that the Wi-Fi Alliance is attempting to circumvent the rules for portable devices by 
placing its proposed new class of devices under the fixed device rules.123
52. Decision. We decline to establish a new class of fixed indoor devices as requested by the 
Wi-Fi Alliance.124 The Wi-Fi Alliance states that the devices of interest would be mass market Mode II 
personal/portable devices, thus indicating to us that they would be small and easily transportable.125 We 
find that such devices would have a high potential for causing interference to authorized services in the 
TV bands if they did not incorporate a geo-location capability to accurately determine their location.  The 
devices could easily be moved to a different location without updating the coordinates, where they would 
then receive an inaccurate list of available channels.126 In the absence of a geo-location capability, the 
coordinates would have to be manually entered into a device.  In the case of mass market consumer 
devices, we would not consider the consumer to be a professional installer.127 We expect that many 
consumers would lack knowledge or experience in determining and entering a device’s coordinates and 
therefore would be likely to make more errors than a professional installer or, alternately, would be more 
likely to enter an improper set of coordinates.  While we are denying the Wi-Fi Alliance’s request to 
create a new category of TV bands device, as we noted above the current rules do in fact contain 
provisions that allow TV bands devices to operate without GPS under certain circumstances.  
Specifically, a personal/portable device can operate without GPS in Mode I if it communicates with either 
a fixed device or a Mode II personal/portable device that provides it with a list of available channels on 
which it can operate.
E. Confidentiality of database information
53. In the Second MO&O, the Commission decided that all information that is required by 
the Commission’s rules to be in a TV bands database is to be publicly available, including fixed TV bands 
device registration and voluntarily submitted protected entity information, such as cable headends.128 The 
Commission noted that the registration of a protected entity in the database will preclude operation of TV 
bands devices on one or more channels over specific areas and that there is the possibility of errors in the 
  
121 See NAB opposition at 8.
122 See Shure reply to oppositions at 6-7.
123 See NCTA opposition at 3.
124 NAB argues that the request to establish a new class of TV bands device is untimely because the requirement to 
include a geo-location capability in fixed and Mode II personal/portable devices was adopted in the 2008 Second 
Report and Order. Because we are denying this request, we will not address NAB’s argument concerning its 
timeliness.
125 See Wi-Fi Alliance petition at 2.
126 Unlike Mode II personal/portable devices, fixed devices are not required to re-establish their coordinates each 
time they are powered up.  However, an operator would have to re-establish the location of (and update the database 
registration for) a fixed device if it is moved to another location or if its stored coordinates are altered.  See 47 
C.F.R. § 15.711(b)(1).

registration information.129 It further noted that while much of the data will come from Commission 
databases that already are public sources, errors could result from the inadvertent entry of incorrect data 
or as a result of a party deliberately entering false data.130 The Commission therefore found that it is 
appropriate to permit public examination of protected entity registration information to allow the 
detection and correction of errors.131
54. Petitions and Replies.  NCTA requests that the Commission reconsider its decision to 
make all information in the TV bands database publicly available and in particular information identifying 
the precise geographic coordinates of cable headends and tower receive sites.132 It argues that a lack of 
security measures to protect this information could endanger critical infrastructure for broadband Internet, 
VOIP, emergency alert messaging, and other critical communications services.  NCTA further argues that 
directives from the Department of Homeland Security require greater protections for critical 
communications infrastructure and that the Commission should require databases to incorporate measures 
to limit access to registered device manufacturers and operators of broadcasting and communications 
businesses.133 NCTA believes that devices that receive TV bands database information should receive 
only the list of channels available for use and that adequate security measures must be incorporated to 
ensure that sensitive database information cannot be accessed through displays, device ports, or 
unprotected interfaces.
55. PISC opposes NCTA’s petition, arguing that NCTA does not suggest any credible reason 
why cable headends are likely targets for terrorists and saboteurs.134 It argues that NCTA’s request is 
overly broad and would limit access to information in databases to a handful of TV band incumbents and 
private companies.135 PISC further argues that cable headend information is already publicly available in 
cable companies’ public inspection files and that public access to information in the TV bands database is 
necessary for data that serves as “licensing information” to allow protected entities to reserve TV band 
channels and preclude TV bands device access.136 NCTA disagrees with PISC, arguing that cable 
headends are considered “critical infrastructure” by the Federal Government.137 It states that while 
information on cable headends is already publicly available, the TV bands database would be the first 
comprehensive repository of headend and tower site information in an easily accessible public 
database.138 NCTA states that its petition is not a pretext for limiting access to all information in a 
database and that registered device manufacturers and operators of broadcasting and communications 
businesses should be permitted to view information on cable headends in the database.139 Google agrees 
that some information in the database may be sensitive in nature and require protection from public 
disclosure, although it does not provide any specific examples.140 However, Google does not agree that

the Commission should limit information exchanged between a database and TV bands device to a list of 
available channels because that could inhibit innovation such as the creation of value-added services.141  
The Wi-Fi Alliance recommends that the Commission restrict access for viewing the locations of critical 
communications infrastructure in the database to certain authorized users.142  
56. Decision. We decline to require that the geographic coordinates or other information 
concerning cable headends in the TV bands database be kept confidential.  First, we note that NCTA 
previously participated in this proceeding but never alleged prior to filing its petition that there is any 
need to keep information on cable headends confidential.  The issue of public availability of database 
information was raised in the petitions for reconsideration of the Second Report and Order in this 
proceeding, and NCTA raised no concerns about the confidentiality of headend registrations in its 
response to these petitions.143 In any case, we are not persuaded that making information about cable 
headends publicly available poses a security threat to communications infrastructure.  Based on the 
documents referenced in NCTA’s petition, virtually all communications facilities, including wireline, 
wireless, satellite, cable, and broadcasting facilities, could be classified as critical infrastructure.144  
Information on a large number of these communications facilities is already publicly available through the 
Commission’s databases, and there is no evidence that the public availability of this information has ever 
posed a threat to the security of communications infrastructure.145 Also, as NCTA and PISC note, 
information on the locations of cable headends is already publicly available from other sources, and the 
TV bands databases will only list those facilities that are outside the protected contours of the over-the-air 
TV stations being received and that the headend operator chooses to register.146
57. While we are upholding the Commission’s previous decision to make all information in 
the TV bands database publicly available, we note that the Second MO&O did not include specific text to 
codify this decision.  We are therefore adding a new paragraph to Section 15.715 of the rules to specify 
that database administrators must provide a means to allow public access to the information in the 
database.  Such access will be limited to the information that is required by the rules to be included in the 
databases and will not include any additional information that the database administrators may choose to 
collect.  OET will advise the database administrators as necessary to implement this requirement.  
Codifying this rule does not impose any new costs or other burdens on database administrators because 
they were already required to provide the capability described.

142 See Wi-Fi Alliance opposition at 4.
143 In its petition for reconsideration of the Second Report and Order, PISC requested that the Commission make all 
information in the TV bands database publicly available.  See PISC petition for reconsideration of the Second Report 
and Order at 14.  NCTA also filed a petition for reconsideration of the Second Report and Order and filed 
comments in response to other petitions, but it raised no objections to PISC’s request to make TV bands database 
information publicly available.
144 See NCTA reply to oppositions at 2.  In footnote 5, NCTA cites page 12 of the U.S. Department of Homeland 
Security’s Communications Sector-Specific Plan to argue that cable headends are classified as critical infrastructure.  
This document lists all communications sectors, including the wireline, wireless, satellite, cable, and broadcasting 
sectors.
145 For example, information on broadcast facilities is publicly available through the Commission’s Consolidated 
Database System (CDBS), and information on satellite and wireless services is publicly available through the 
Commission’s Universal Licensing System (ULS).
146 Headends that are more than 80 km outside the protected contour of the TV station being received may be 
registered only if the Commission grants a waiver of the 80 km distance limit in Section 15.712(b) of the rules.

F. Other Matters
58. As discussed above, OET designated ten parties as TV bands database administrators147  
and requires them to attend workshops conducted by Commission staff.148  During the course of these 
workshops, the database administrators have noted that some rules require Commission interpretation and 
guidance to ensure that they are implemented consistently across all TV White Space databases.  OET 
staff has provided guidance on how certain rules as written should be implemented by the database 
administrators.  Information regarding these discussions, including any rule interpretations provided to 
the database administrators at these workshops, is posted on the Commission’s web site at 
http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/white-space-database-administration. In two cases, discussed below, we 
conclude that the rules should be modified to clearly state the requirements for protecting these services. 
1. TV translator, low power TV and Class A TV station receive sites
59. The rules require that TV bands databases contain information on the location of receive 
sites for TV translator, low power TV, and Class A TV stations (collectively low power stations) and the 
channels of TV signals received for retransmission at such sites.149 Our Consolidated Data Base System 
(CDBS) has the ability to store receive site information for low power stations, but the receive site 
information currently contained in the CDBS is incomplete or inaccurate and therefore not always 
reliable.  For this reason, the Commission adopted rules that require low power stations to register their 
receive sites with the TV bands database administrators to obtain protection.  Subsequent to the adoption 
of these rules, we have become concerned that if we were to allow parties to register receive site 
information both in the TV bands database and the CDBS, there could be conflicts in the data between the 
CDBS and the database registrations due to data entry errors or updates to the information in one database 
but not the other.  We therefore find it is necessary to provide for a single registry for low power station 
receive site information, and that registry is to be the CDBS.  The Commission’s staff has constructed a 
webpage interface that will allow licensees of low power stations to easily provide us with their correct 
receive channel information.  The information collected through this webpage interface will be used to 
update the CDBS.  The Commission will issue a public notice when the interface is available to the public 
and will provide instructions on how to access it.
60. In view of our decision to acquire and maintain all low power station receive site data by 
means of the new receive site update facility and the CDBS system, we no longer find it necessary to 
require database administrators to provide a separate registration process for this information.  In addition 
to relieving the database operators of a significant burden, this change will make the low power station 
receive site data in the CDBS more reliable and also avoid data conflicts between the CDBS and the 
database registration records.  Accordingly, we are modifying Section 15.713(b)(2) of the rules to remove 
receive sites of TV translator, low power TV, and Class A TV stations from the list of facilities that are 
not contained in Commission databases and placing them in Section 15.713(b)(1) in the list of facilities 
that are contained in Commission databases.  We are also modifying Section 15.715(c) to remove TV 
translator receive sites as an example of facilities not contained in Commission databases.  These rule 
changes are procedural in nature in that we are changing the manner in which low power TV receive site 
information is collected and placed in the TV bands databases, but not the protection afforded to receive 
  
147 See supra footnote 12.
148 The Chief of the OET has delegated authority to develop specific methods that will be used to designate TV 
bands database managers, to designate these database managers; to develop procedures that these database managers 
will use to ensure compliance with the requirements for database operations; to make determinations regarding the 
continued acceptability of individual database managers; and to perform other functions as needed for the 
administration of the TV bands databases.  See 47 C.F.R. § 0.241(h).

sites.  Thus, these changes do not require prior notice under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA).150
2. Protection of radio astronomy
61. Section 15.712(h) of the rules prohibits the operation of TV bands devices within 2.4 
kilometers of certain radio astronomy and other receive sites to prevent interference to operations at those 
locations.  This rule section specifies the geographic coordinates of receive sites that were provided to the 
Commission by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) in 2005.  
NTIA recently discovered inaccuracies in the coordinates for several radio astronomy receive sites and 
filed a request with the Commission to correct these inaccuracies.151 In particular, it provided corrected 
coordinates for the Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico and the Table Mountain receive site in Colorado.  
NTIA also requested that we modify the receive site coordinates listed in Section 15.712(h) to match 
those in footnote US388 to the Table Of Frequency Allocations in Section 2.106 of the rules because it 
determined that the coordinates in that footnote are correct.152 We find that NTIA’s requested changes to 
this section will ensure that radio astronomy and other receive sites are protected against interference 
from TV bands devices and are therefore updating the rules to reflect the correct coordinates. In addition, 
we note that Section 15.712(h)(1) lists the Naval Radio Research Observatory in Sugar Grove, West 
Virginia as a protected site but does not specify its geographic coordinates.  We are therefore revising this 
section to add the coordinates of that observatory.  These rule revisions do not require TV bands devices 
to protect any additional radio astronomy sites or increase the size of the protected zones around them; 
they merely provide more precise geographic coordinates for the sites that TV bands devices were already 
required to protect.  We find that these changes are insignificant in nature and impact, and inconsequential 
to the industry and the public.  Thus, these rule changes do not require prior notice under the APA.153

Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA), Public Law 104-13. It will be submitted to the Office of 
Management and Budget (OMB) for review under Section 3507(d) of the PRA. OMB, the general public, 
and other Federal agencies are invited to comment on the new or modified information collection 
requirements contained in this proceeding. In addition, we note that pursuant to the Small Business

APPENDIX B
Final Rules
Parts 15 of Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations is amended as follows:
PART 15 RADIO FREQUENCY DEVICES
1. The authority citation for Part 15 continues to read as follows:
AUTHORITY:  47 U.S.C. 154, 302a, 303, 304, 307, 336, and 544a
§ 15.709 General technical requirements.
(a) * * *
(5) The power spectral density from the TVBD shall not be greater than the following values when 
measured in any 100 kHz band during any time interval of continuous transmission.  
(i) Fixed devices: 12.6 dBm conducted power.  If transmitting antennas of directional gain greater than 6 
dBi are used, this conducted power level shall be reduced by the amount in dB that the directional gain of 
the antenna exceeds 6 dBi.
(ii) Personal/portable device operating adjacent to occupied TV channels: -1.4 dBm EIRP.
(iii) Sensing-only devices: -0.4 dBm EIRP.
(iv) All other personal/portable devices: 2.6 dBm EIRP.
* * * * *
(b) * * *
(2) The transmit antenna used with fixed devices may not be more than 30 meters above the ground.  In 
addition, fixed devices may not be located at sites where the antenna height above average terrain is more 
than 250 meters.  The HAAT is to be calculated by the TV bands database that the device contacts for 
available channels using computational software employing the methodology in §73.684(d) of this 
chapter.
* * * * *
(c)* * *
(1) In the television channels immediately adjacent to the channel in which the TVBD is operating, 
emissions from the TVBD shall not exceed the following levels.
(i) Fixed devices: -42.8 dBm conducted power.
(ii) Personal/portable device operating adjacent to occupied TV channels: -56.8 dBm EIRP.
(iii) Sensing-only devices: -55.8 dBm EIRP.
(iv) All other personal/portable devices: -52.8 dBm EIRP.
(2) Emission measurements in the adjacent channels shall be performed using a minimum resolution 
bandwidth of 100 kHz with an average detector. A narrower resolution bandwidth may be employed near 
the band edge, when necessary, provided the measured energy is integrated to show the total power over 
100 kHz.
* * * * *
2. Section 15.711 is amended by revising paragraph (b)(3)(iv) to read as follows:
§ 15.711 Interference avoidance methods.
Federal Communications Commission FCC 12-36
28
* * * * *
(b) * * *
(3) * * *
(iv) (A) A Mode I personal/portable TVBD may only transmit upon receiving a list of available channels 
from a fixed or Mode II TVBD.  A fixed or Mode II device may provide a Mode I device with a list of 
available channels only after it contacts its database, provides the database the FCC Identifier (FCC ID) 
of the Mode I device requesting available channels, and receives verification that the FCC ID is valid for 
operation.
(B) A Mode II device must provide a list of channels to the Mode I device that is the same as the list of 
channels available to the Mode II device. 
(C) A fixed device may provide a list of available channels to a Mode I device only if the fixed device 
HAAT as verified by the TV bands database does not exceed 106 meters.  The fixed device must provide 
a list of available channels to the Mode I device that is the same as the list of channels available to the 
fixed device, except that a Mode I device may operate only on those channels that are permissible for its 
use under §15.707.  A fixed device may also obtain from a database a separate list of available channels 
that includes adjacent channels that would be available to a Mode I personal/portable device and provide 
that list to the Mode I device. 
(D) To initiate contact with a fixed or Mode II device, a Mode I device may transmit on an available 
channel used by the fixed or Mode II TVBD or on a channel the fixed or Mode II TVBD indicates is 
available for use by a Mode I device on a signal seeking such contacts.  At least once every 60 seconds, 
except when in sleep mode, i.e., a mode in which the device is inactive but is not powered-down, a Mode 
I device must either receive a contact verification signal from the Mode II or fixed device that provided its 
current list of available channels or contact a Mode II or fixed device to re-verify/re-establish channel 
availability.  A Mode I device must cease operation immediately if it does not receive a contact 
verification signal or is not able to re-establish a list of available channels through contact with a fixed or 
Mode II device on this schedule.  In addition, a Mode II device must re-check/re-establish contact with a 
fixed or Mode II device to obtain a list of available channels if it loses power. Collaterally, if a Mode II 
device loses power and obtains a new channel list, it must signal all Mode I devices it is serving to 
acquire and use a new channel list.
* * * * *
3. Section 15.712 is amended by replacing the table in paragraph (a)(2), adding a new paragraph 
(a)(3) and revising paragraph (h) to read as follows:

APPENDIX C
Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis
As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA),1 an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis 
(IRFA) was incorporated in the Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) in ET Docket No. 04-186,2 and 
an additional IRFA was incorporated in the First Report and Order and Further Notice of Proposed Rule 
Making (Further Notice) in ET Docket No. 04-186.3 The Commission sought written public comment on 
the proposals in the NPRM and in the Further Notice, including comment on the IRFAs.  No comments 
were received in response to either IRFA.  This present Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (FRFA) 
conforms to the RFA.4
A. Need for, and Objectives of, the Third Memorandum Opinion and Order 
This Third Memorandum Opinion and Order responds to five petitions for reconsideration that 
were filed in response to the Second Memorandum Opinion and Order (“Second MO&O”) in this 
proceeding.5 It eliminates the 76 meter limitation on the height above average terrain of the sites where 
fixed TV bands devices may operate and increases the maximum permitted antenna height above average 
terrain from 106 meters to 250 meters.  The Third Memorandum Opinion and Order also replaces the 
current relative limit with a fixed limit for TV bands device emissions that fall in the 6 MHz channels 
adjacent to the operating channel.  Devices operating at the maximum permitted power must suppress 
adjacent channel emissions to the same level that the current rules require, but devices operating at less 
than the maximum power do not have to suppress emissions below this level.  However, the Third 
Memorandum Opinion and Order upholds the majority of the Commission’s prior decisions permitting 
unlicensed broadband operations in the TV bands while making certain other minor changes and 
refinements to the rules for TV band devices.  The Commission believes that these changes and 
clarifications to the rules will better ensure that licensed services are protected from interference while 
retaining flexibility for unlicensed devices to share spectrum with new services or to change frequencies 
if TV spectrum is reallocated for other purposes.
B. Statement of Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments in Response to the IRFA
There were no public comments filed that specifically addressed the rules and policies proposed 
in the IRFA.
C. Response to Comments by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business 
Administration
Pursuant to the Small Business Jobs Act of 2010, the Commission is required to respond to any 
comments filed by the Chief Counsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and to provide

a detailed statement of any change made to the proposed rules as a result of those comments.  The Chief 
Counsel did not file any comments in response to the proposed rules in this proceeding.
D. Description and Estimate of the Number of Small Entities To Which Rules Will Apply
The RFA directs agencies to provide a description of, and, where feasible, an estimate of, the 
number of small entities that may be affected by the rules adopted herein.6 The RFA generally defines 
the term “small entity” as having the same meaning as the terms “small business,” “small organization,” 
and “small governmental jurisdiction.”7 In addition, the term “small business” has the same meaning as 
the term “small business concern” under the Small Business Act.8 A “small business concern” is one 
which: (1) is independently owned and operated; (2) is not dominant in its field of operation; and (3) 
satisfies any additional criteria established by the Small Business Administration (SBA).9  
Radio and Television Broadcasting and Wireless Communications Equipment Manufacturing. 
The Census Bureau defines this category as follows: “This industry comprises establishments primarily 
engaged in manufacturing radio and television broadcast and wireless communications equipment.FN1  
Examples of products made by these establishments are: transmitting and receiving antennas, cable 
television equipment, GPS equipment, pagers, cellular phones, mobile communications equipment, and 
radio and television studio and broadcasting equipment.”10  In this category, the SBA has deemed a 
business manufacturing radio and television broadcasting equipment, wireless telecommunications 
equipment, or both, to be small if it has fewer than 750 employees.11 For this category of manufacturing, 
Census data for 2007 show that there were 919 firms that operated that year. Of those establishments, 531 
had between 1 and 19 employees; 240 had between 20 and 99 employees; and 148 had more than 100 
employees.12 Since 771 establishments had fewer than 100 employees, and since only 148 had more than 
100 employees, the vast majority of manufacturers in this category would be considered small under 
applicable standards.
Wireless Telecommunications Carriers (except satellite). Since 2007, the Census Bureau has 
placed wireless firms within this new, broad, economic census category.13  Under the present and prior 
categories, the SBA has deemed a wireless business to be small if it has 1,500 or fewer employees.14 For

Act, 15 U.S.C. § 632).  Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 601(3), the statutory definition of a small business applies “unless an 
agency, after consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after opportunity 
for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are appropriate to the activities of the 
agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal Register.”

this category, census data for 2007 show that there were 1,383 firms that operated for the entire year.15  
Of this total, 1,368 firms had employment of 999 or fewer employees and 15 had employment of 1000 
employees or more.16 Similarly, according to Commission data, 413 carriers reported that they were 
engaged in the provision of wireless telephony, including cellular service, Personal Communications 
Service (PCS), and Specialized Mobile Radio (SMR) Telephony services.17 Of these, an estimated 261 
have 1,500 or fewer employees and 152 have more than 1,500 employees.18 Consequently, the 
Commission estimates that approximately half or more of these firms can be considered small. Thus, 
using available data, we estimate that the majority of wireless firms can be considered small.
E. Description of Projected Reporting, Record Keeping, and Other Compliance Requirements
TV bands devices are required to be authorized under the Commission's certification procedure as 
a prerequisite to marketing and importation, and the Third Memorandum Opinion and Order makes no 
change to that requirement.  However, it makes certain changes to the technical requirements for TV 
bands devices, which are discussed below.
F. Steps Taken to Minimize Significant Economic Impact on Small Entities, and Significant 
Alternatives Considered
The RFA requires an agency to describe any significant alternatives that it has considered in 
developing its approach, which may include the following four alternatives (among others): “(1) the 
establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the 
resources available to small entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation, or simplification of compliance 
and reporting requirements under the rule for such small entities; (3) the use of performance rather than 
design standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof, for such small 
entities.”19  
While the Third Memorandum Opinion and Order generally upholds the rules adopted in the 
Second Memorandum Opinion and Order, the Commission made certain changes to those rules. It 
believed those changes and clarifications would provide for improved protection of licensed services in 
the TV bands, resolve certain uncertainties in the rules, and provide manufacturers with greater flexibility 
in designing products to meet market demands. 
The Commission eliminated the prohibition on fixed TV bands device operation at sites where the 
ground elevation is more than 76 meters above the average elevation of the surrounding terrain, while 
maintaining the current antenna height above ground limit of 30 meters.  In place of the site elevation 
limit, the Commission adopted a requirement that a fixed device may operate with an antenna height 
above average terrain of up to 250 meters, which is an increase from the current antenna height above 
average terrain limit of 106 meters (30 meters antenna height above ground plus 76 meters site above 
average terrain). Under the new rule, a fixed TV bands device could operate from a site with an elevation

Firms for the United States: 2007 NAICS Code 517210” (issued Nov. 2010).

1,500 or fewer employees; the largest category provided is for firms with “100 employees or more.”

Federal Communications Commission FCC 12-36
35
of up to 220 meters above average terrain using an antenna height above ground of 30 meters, resulting in 
an antenna height above average terrain of 250 meters.  In reaching this decision, the Commission 
considered the competing views from various parties on whether the ground elevation limit unnecessarily 
restricts the locations where fixed TV bands devices can operate and whether an increase in the maximum 
antenna height above ground and average terrain can allow greater coverage by fixed TV bands devices 
without causing interference to authorized users of the TV bands.  The Commission believes that the 
changes it adopted will allow for increased availability of wireless broadband services in rural and 
underserved areas while protecting television and other services that operate in the TV bands.
The Commission made certain changes to the technical requirements for TV bands devices.  
Specifically, it modified the limits for emissions that fall in TV channels adjacent to those where a TV 
bands device operates by specifying limits that are at fixed levels, rather than relative to the in-band 
power.  This change simplifies compliance measurements, because it will no longer be necessary to 
compare the in-band and adjacent channel power, which had to be measured with two different 
bandwidths under the previous rules.  Instead, compliance can be determined by directly measuring the 
adjacent channel power in a specified bandwidth for comparison to the limit. The rule changes that the 
Commission adopted also eliminate the need for devices operating at less than the maximum permitted 
power to suppress adjacent channel emissions to levels below those needed to prevent interference to 
other services in the TV bands.  In reaching its decision to modify the adjacent channel emission limits, 
the Commission considered and rejected requests for a greater relaxation of the limit.  The Commission 
found that the adopted limits are necessary to prevent interference to authorized services in and adjacent 
to the TV bands and to allow more efficient use of the TV spectrum by both licensed and unlicensed 
devices.  The Commission recognized petitioners’ arguments that tighter emission limits can result in 
higher equipment costs.  However, the record indicated that at least one equipment manufacturer is 
capable of complying with the limits adopted in the Second Memorandum Opinion and Order.20 The 
Commission noted that tighter out-of-band emission limits can allow users to operate in adjacent 
frequency bands with less geographic separation between them, thus enabling more efficient and intensive 
use of spectrum.  Thus, it found that the benefits of tighter out-of-band emission limits outweigh the 
increase in equipment cost necessary to comply with the limits.
G. Report to Congress
The Commission will send a copy of the Third Memorandum Opinion and Order, including this 
FRFA, in a report to Congress and the Government Accountability Office pursuant to the Congressional 
Review Act.21 A copy of the Third Memorandum Opinion and Order and FRFA (or summaries thereof) 
will also be published in the Federal Register.22

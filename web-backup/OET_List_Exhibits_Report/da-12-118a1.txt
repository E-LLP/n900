Office of Engineering and Technology Requests Comment on the Public Testing 
of Telcordia Technologies Inc.’s TV Bands Database System
ET Docket No. 04-186
Comments due:  February 16, 2012
Reply comments due:  February 23, 2012
The Commission’s Office of Engineering and Technology (OET) is requesting comment on the 
45-day public trial of Telcordia Technologies Inc.’s (Telcordia’s) TV bands database system that was 
completed on January 20, 2012.  This database system is designed and intended to support the operation 
of unlicensed transmitting devices on unoccupied spectrum within the broadcast television bands.  Such 
unoccupied spectrum is commonly known as the TV “White Spaces.”
In a Public Notice released December 2, 2011, DA 11-1956, OET announced that, beginning 
December 7, 2011, it was conducting a 45-day public trial of Telcordia’s TV bands database system.  This 
trial allowed the public to access and participate in the testing of the Telcordia database system to ensure 
that it correctly identifies channels that are available for unlicensed TV bands devices, properly registers 
facilities entitled to protection, and provides protection to authorized services and registered facilities as 
specified in the rules.  Participants were encouraged to report any inaccuracies or other issues with any 
aspect of the database system to Telcordia.
Telcordia has provided a summary report on the trial of its TV bands database system to OET.  
This summary report identifies: 1) problems reported and their disposition and 2) descriptions of changes 
made by Telcordia to the channel availability calculator or registration systems during the trial period.  
We are requesting that interested parties submit comments on the trial and this report. A copy of 
Telcordia’s summary report and its three attachments is available on the Commission’s Electronic 
Comment Filing System (ECFS) at 
Summary Report: http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/ecfs/document/view?id=7021857325
The successful performance of the database system through this trial is only one element in the 
Commission’s evaluation of a system for approval to operate.   Other requirements for TV bands database 
systems are set forth in 47 C.F.R. 15.701 et seq. and OET’s January 26, 2011, Order on TV bands 
database administrators (see Order in ET Docket No. 04-186, DA 11-131).  OET will grant final approval 
for Telcordia to operate its database system with certified TV bands devices once it determines that the 
2
system complies with all of the applicable rules and requirements.  The public will be informed of such 
decision through a Public Notice.
The TV bands database systems are the subject of a docketed proceeding, ET Docket No. 04-
186, and comments and reply comments addressing the trial of Telcordia’s database system must be filed 
in that proceeding using the FCC’s ECFS as described below.  A simplified interface for ECFS has been 
implemented to facilitate consumer comment.  Documents filed on ECFS may be accessed and reviewed 
on that system, which contains copies of written submissions and summaries of oral submissions 
regarding the white spaces proceeding.

system and its report on the trial by February 16, 2012 and February 23, 2012, respectively.  As

Comment Filing System. See Electronic Filing of Documents in Rulemaking Proceedings, 63 FR 24121
